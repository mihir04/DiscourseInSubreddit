[x-post r\/learnprogramming]","DataScience","TL;DR: learned a buncha shit in 20 months with no prior anything-related experience, got job as data scientist\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEdit: Seems like this was removed from r\/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFirst, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn\u2019t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSecond, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor\u2019s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master\u2019s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don\u2019t be afraid to switch jobs when you\u2019re bored or it\u2019s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 1:**\n\n\nGet your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they\u2019re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn\u2019t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.\n\n\nMy first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.\n\n\nCongrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 2:**\n\n\nI got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do \/s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn\u2019t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.\n\n\nThe amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it\u2019s always good to mention how much data you\u2019ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don\u2019t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.\n\n\nBy no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT\u2019s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx\u2019s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn\u2019t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.\n\n\nBut! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you\u2019re leaning towards the development side.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 3:**\n\n\nI left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it\u2019s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won\u2019t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.\n\n\nDuring my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan\u2019s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn\u2019t too challenging. \n\n\nAfter that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla\u2019s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It\u2019s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It\u2019s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn\u2019t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.\n\n\nThis is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford\u2019s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng\u2019s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**\n\n\nThere are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:\n\n\n*Resume*\n\n\n1.\tKept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) \n\n2.\tUnder my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page\n\n\n3.\tRecent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.\n\n\nNote: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it\u2019s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.\n\n\n4.\tI read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!\n\n5.\tBelow that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs\n\n\n6.\tAnd lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don\u2019t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they\u2019d like to see my what I do on the side. I\u2019ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I\u2019m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!\n\n*Linkedin*\n\n1.\tProfessional-looking photo. Doesn\u2019t have to be professional, just professional-looking.\n\n2.\tFill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you\u2019ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.\n\n\n3.\tI only filled out the description for my most recent job because that\u2019s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description\n\n4.\tPut all my certifications from the courses I took with links\n\n\n5.\tPut my education, obvs\n\n6.\tThe rest\u2026eh. Doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 5: Job Search**\n\n\nSo you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?\n\n\nI stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. \n\n\nThe single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- \u201cjunior data scientist\u201d, \u201cdata scientist\u201d, \u201csenior analytics\u201d, \u201csenior data analyst\u201d, \u201cjunior machine learning\u201d, \u201centry data science\u201d, and so on. When you\u2019re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can\u2019t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you\u2019re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 6: The initial call**\n\n\nI\u2019ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn\u2019t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).\n\n\nHere were most of the things I was asked:\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat tools I used at work \n\n\n\u2022\tHow have I made processes more efficient at work\n\n\n\u2022\tAnything I\u2019ve automated \n\n\n\u2022\tLargest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result\n\n\n\u2022\tWhy the shift from the current job\n\n\n\u2022\tHow much I know about their company and how I\u2019d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)\n\n\nI had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I\u2019ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 7: The data exercise**\n\n\nFrom those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.\n\n\nThe first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.\n\n\nDid I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn\u2019t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn\u2019t feel complete. I couldn\u2019t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.\n\n\nThe end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn\u2019t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. \n\n\nThe second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I\u2019ll go into in the next step.\n\n\nThe last exercise was codility- and while my code \u201cworked\u201d, there was likely some test cases I didn\u2019t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn\u2019t follow through.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 8: The in-person interview**\n\n\nSo you got to this stage! Congrats!\n\n\nAnd you\u2019ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you\u2019ve never met this many executives in your whole life.\n\n\nNo need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You\u2019ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. \n\n\nEven if I hadn\u2019t made it past this, I tasted victory.\n\n\nI did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn\u2019t prepare for questions they\u2019d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I\u2019d ask them. This did two things: I didn\u2019t obsess about what they\u2019d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they\u2019d ask questions about how I\u2019d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that\u2019s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it\u2019s a way of thinking you\u2019d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you\u2019ll know what you did inside out, so it\u2019s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don\u2019t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!\n\n\nHere are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP of Data Science**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn\u2019t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it\u2019s what he was thinking too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How\u2019s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I\u2019d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they\u2019d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What\u2019s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they\u2019re working on, what\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP Tech**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I\u2019m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn\u2019t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that\u2019s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I\u2019d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Cool man!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe probably liked that I wasn\u2019t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**COO, President** \n\n\n\u2022\t*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with \u201cNothing? Not even selling lemonade?\u201d. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won\u2019t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I\u2019m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I\u2019d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I\u2019m all for that. I\u2019m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the \u201cfinding meaning\u201d part.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn\u2019t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Data Scientists**\n\n\nSit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**VP Marketing (first form)**\n\n\nThis was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn\u2019t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.\n\n\nThat concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn\u2019t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**CMO** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven\u2019t experienced it before so I\u2019d have to learn how to operate within that structure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I\u2019m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn\u2019t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it\u2019s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn\u2019t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP Marketing (final form)**\n\n\nHere he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain\u2019s gears go overdrive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A\/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A\/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Walk me through how you'll implement A\/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven\u2019t done it in practice. Couldn\u2019t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng\u2019s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I\u2019ve described here- that I felt useless after my master\u2019s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI asked him:\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are the projects I'll work on in the first month?\n\n\n\u2022\tYou worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?\n\n\nAnd! I give you the absolute best question to ask:\n\n\n\u2022\t\u201cYou\u2019ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I\u2019d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.\u201d\n\n\nBoom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn\u2019t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like \u201cpeace!\u201d\n\n\nAnd that was that!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**\n\n\nTitle says it all. It\u2019s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don\u2019t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning\/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don\u2019t let up!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 10: Negotiate**\n\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I\u2019m not a fan of this explanation but I\u2019ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don\u2019t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It\u2019s uncomfortable, you\u2019ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they\u2019ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It\u2019s business. It\u2019s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you\u2019ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I\u2019ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.kalzumeus.com\/2012\/01\/23\/salary-negotiation\/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:\n\n\n-\tYou don\u2019t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)\n\n\n-\tGlassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It\u2019s almost effortless\n\n\n-\tAbsorb everything you can. A lot of it won\u2019t stick, but a lot of it will.\n\n\n-\tLearning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.\n\n\n-\tUSE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. \n\n\n-\tIn case you couldn\u2019t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers\n\n\n-\tTalk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they\u2019re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you\u2019re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.\n\n\n-\tYou\u2019ll stumble through a lot of material- and that\u2019s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You\u2019ll reach the \u201caha!\u201d moment when everything clicks and you \u201cget it\u201d. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?\n\n\n-\tAdding to the last point, it\u2019s hard to know where to start and where to go. I\u2019ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you\u2019re lost!\n\n\n-\tGet ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn\u2019t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. \n\n\n-\tI did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You\u2019ll burn out sometimes, and that\u2019s okay! If you\u2019re as driven and passionate as I was, you\u2019ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.\n\n\n-\tLastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r\/learnprogramming or r\/datascience or r\/jobs or r\/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Quick start guide for data science:**\n\n\n(in no particular order)\n\n\n-\tIntroduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org\n\n\n-\tEither:\n\n\no\tAndrew Ng\u2019s Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)\n\n\no\tStatistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)\n\n\n-\tPython Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy\nAgain, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFull list of courses I\u2019ve completed:\n\n\u2022\tComplete Python Web Course from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tComplete Python and PostgreSQL Developer Course from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tDeeplearning.ai's Specialization from Coursera\n\n\u2022\tStatistical Learning from Stanford Lagunita\n\n\u2022\tPython for Data Science and Machine Learning from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tIntroduction to Data Science in Python from Coursera\n\n\u2022\tIntroduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python from Edx\n\n\u2022\tAnalytics Edge from Edx\n\n\u2022\tMachine Learning from Coursera\n\nThanks for reading! Wishing you the best in your data science journey. I hope it\u2019s as rewarding, exciting, and fruitful as it was for me.\n\n"],["Data Scientist: \\'d\u0101d\u0259 \u02c8s\u012b\u0259n(t)\u0259st\\ (n.)","DataScience",""],["Hey all.

It was my first interview for a data scientist role and I had to interview with over a dozen people including multiple leaders within the company. Even before I was invited for a face to face interview, I underwent a coding assessment (timed). I usually do not do well in timed challenges as they make me nervous and I can get flustered easily. They rejected me after the assignment (I received the news while I was waiting in the lounge of another company getting ready for my final interviews with the second firm for a Developer role). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut after the rejection, I decided that it wasn't the best assessment of my performance and I took all the feedback the team had for me and re-did the challenge over the course of next week. I reached out to the company again with my results and asked them to reconsider my work (with little expectation). I think the company liked my initiative and they invited me for onsite interviews. I said yes to this since I had another offer for a different role from a startup. My onsite interviews were average at best and shitty at worst. I felt I did not do well and went to bed at 5 in the evening. I could not answer questions from past since most of these questions were from five years ago. During the technical interview, the interviewers were looking for a very specific answer, but I had zero clue on what exactly they were looking for.

This is just how real data scientists dress.","DataScience",""],["Data Science Cheatsheets","DataScience",""],["Play Your Charts Right | An Illustrated Collection of Mistakes People Often Make When Visualizing Data","DataScience",""],["Why arguing about who is a \"Real Data Scientist\" is a misguided exercise","DataScience","One of the most common arguments these days revolves around what constitutes a \"real\" Data Scientist, and by proxy, who is deserving of the Data Scientist title. A popular opinion is that Data Scientists need to do machine learning or they're not real data scientists.\n\nI think this completely misses the point of job titles: job titles are not meant to define a role. Job titles are meant to be corporate abbreviations for job descriptions. It is job descriptions that are matched against outside salary references, and it is job descriptions that are graded for pay purposes. Job descriptions are used for hiring purposes and ultimately job descriptions describe the job that you do.\n\nThere are some professions where titles have very real meanings (Lawyers who pass the bar exam, Professional Engineers who pass the P.E. exam, Accountants who are certified CPAs, etc.), but the majority of titles don't mean anything, and Data Scientist is certainly in that camp.\n\nOther examples:\n\n- At a lot of large corporation, you see Sr. Managers that don't manage anyone (i.e., have no direct reports).\n\n- Every person in national\/executive sales is a VP, even though they are not responsible for a P&L and often don't even have direct reports. Oh, and they make less money than a Director in every other branch of the company.\n\n- Every bank title is incredibly inflated (again, TONS of VPs)\n\n- Every quant\/trading title is incredibly deflated - they'll seemingly call someone an analyst their whole lives even if they're making 400k and have 15 years experience.\n\nThe only constraints on job titles are often internal, and a consequence of how they fit relative to existing internal job descriptions. Specifically, if a specific job title term (e.g., Engineer, Analyst, Consultant) has traditionally been associated with a certain set of skills and responsibilities, a new role that has completely new requirements should in general avoid using the same title.\n\nSo why are so many companies giving Data Science titles to people who don't do Machine Learning given that the original data scientists had to? Here is what the life-cycle of creating a role looks like *at a company that doesn't have existing data science capabilities*:\n\n1) Hiring manager decides she needs a new person with a profile that doesn't exist in the form of an existing job description. She needs this person to do mostly analysis, but she also needs them to be able to write code in Python to automate some processes, build the occasional model (likely not a production model), and access back-end databases directly and often. She may also, in time, need this person to dedicate more time to building more advanced statistical models, maybe even ML models, but as of right now that is highly uncertain because the company has never used ML in the past.\n\n2) After writing this job description, the key hitting points look something like this: \n\n* Must have 2+ years experience with R\/Python\n* Must have 2+ years experience with SQL\n* Must have experience building statistical models.\n* A whole bunch of business and soft skills stuff\n\n3) HR receives this job description and they now need to grade it. Since they have Analyst\/Sr Analyst roles already, they compare the job description against those roles. They quickly find that none of those job descriptions require R\/Python, SQL or building models. But they do match a lot of the other requirements, so it becomes clear that they will need a different type of role that is both different (includes Python\/SQL\/Modeling) and higher (more requirements) than the existing Analyst\/Sr. Analyst roles. They may have even higher levels of Analyst (Lead, Principal), but none of them will require the use of Python\/SQL\/Modeling, so the fact of the matter is that they are going to need to get away from the Analyst title or otherwise create confusion and internal inconsistencies.\n\n4) In order to do their benchmarking, HR pulls salaries and comp from an external data source that helps them match job description requirements to those posted by other companies. They work their way through putting the job description requirements into the system, and the system tells HR what jobs with similar JDs pay, including a range. It also tells this person the titles of the people who have similar JDs - which will likely include jobs that are legitimate Data Science jobs as they require R, Python, SQL, and statistical modeling experience. But it also will include some Analyst roles that do require programming skills (maybe some quant roles), and other random role titles that no one would think of looking into. All in all, the job grade that comes back is higher than an Analyst role (because of the added skills), but not quite as high as that of the first-gen Data Scientists, i.e., Ph.D. + 5 years experience in Silicon Valley. \n\n5) Now they need a job title. They know they can't name the role \"Analyst\" or \"Sr. Analyst\" because the skill set (and job grading) is different. Therefore they want to avoid having one \"Analyst\" making considerably more money than the rest of the Analysts, and also would like to make it clear that current Analysts may not have the skillset needed for this new role. They may, but it cannot be assumed by default that they do. They currently don't have any data scientists, so there's no toes to step on there, so it becomes a natural solution to name this new role \"Data Scientist\". Why that and not a completely new title to avoid clashing with the existing Data Scientist roles that are more senior in the marketplace?\n\n* **You want a title that can be easily found by people with the right skillset**: because the candidate you are looking for has some characteristics of an old school data scientist and some of an analyst, you want to hit with a title that will catch the high-end of the pool you're looking for. \"Analyst\" may leave some of those people out. \n\n* **You want the role to be easy to find**: you can title the job \"Programming Friendly Analyst\", but it would just make it harder to get it to show up on searches. Meanwhile, because people are searching for the Data Scientist role often, it gives you better visibility. \n\nAnd there you have it, you now have a Data Scientist opening that you can post. Odds are you will get a wide range of candidates applying, including some who will be greatly overqualified (but will inquire because of the Data Science title being so variable), but you will end up hiring someone who is, ideally, at the top end of your requirements.\n\nMore importantly, as more and more companies do this, the general convergence is not based on original data science roles, but rather the new data science roles that are going to be more common because they will fill a need in a much larger market (i.e., more companies need people to tame their data and run basic modeling, fewer companies are ready for cutting edge ML).\n\nYou will certainly have organizations where step 5 is different, i.e., where the \"Analyst\" roles already have programming requirements (quants, consulting are all great examples), and in that case it makes sense that Data Scientist will be defined as \"can do ML\", because the only reason to create a new role will be to differentiate people who can do analysis, modeling, and programming from those who can do all of those things AND build machine learning models.\n\nAnd then you have the even more extreme examples, FANGs, where you are seeing the creation of roles that are even more technical than Data Scientist (like Applied Scientist and Research Scientist and ML Engineer), which - again - were likely required to create internal differentiation between people who can execute machine learning models vs. people who can develop brand new machine learning concepts\/scale machine learning to solve massively complex applications\/etc.\n\nOn to my last point: to those who are on the cutting edge of machine learning and AI knowledge who feel \"icky\" getting lumped in with us simpletons who are just running fancy regression models to make our companies more money - just know that the reason your salaries are continuing to increase is because the number of companies hiring Data people like myself to solve simpleton problems is blowing up the market, and creating a scarcity everywhere in the field that is driving salaries up. So, while I understand that you like the prestige of having a title that reflects just how much more about machine learning you know that the rest of us, please appreciate that the popularity of the general field of Decision Science has greatly benefited you directly.\n\n**TL;DR: No one company\/group of people get to dictate what is\/isn't a \"Data Scientist\". It is a natural response of the market to allow those companies looking for employees to find the right job seekers while satisfying internal corporate constraints. To continue to argue about who is\/isn't a data scientist is pointless, because the title itself actually doesn't mean anything. Most importantly, a rising tide lifts all boats, and we have all benefited from the demand for all types of data scientists.**"],["Pandas Cheat Sheet","DataScience","Hi everyone!\n\nToday I was doing some pandas exercises on Kaggle and I found this cheat sheet that can be really useful on daily work.\n\nI don't know if this is an old news or something but I thought that will be good to share it, especially for beginners as me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Pandas Cheat Sheet: [Link](https:\/\/github.com\/pandas-dev\/pandas\/blob\/master\/doc\/cheatsheet\/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nHere are others cheat sheet resources provided by users:\n\n* R Cheat Sheets: [Link](https:\/\/www.rstudio.com\/resources\/cheatsheets\/)  \\---> @[fr\\_1\\_1992](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/fr_1_1992)\n* ML, DP, AI: [Link](https:\/\/becominghuman.ai\/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-science-pdf-f22dc900d2d7)  \\---> @[EnErgo](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/EnErgo)\n* Numpy, Python, R: [Link](http:\/\/datasciencefree.com\/cheatsheets.html)"],["Some advice for young and aspiring Data Scientists","DataScience","I've decided to make this small post to help people navigate this big world of data science, feel free to ask any follow up questions, and please do not PM me, any questions you have, ask them here, for everyone to see.\n\nMy background: I did a Phd and Masters in Data Science\/ML, ML summer school, ML researcher at UCLA and Data Scientist at NASA. Currently do Data Science as a consulting gig, with a company.\n\n**Architectures**\n\n- Learn how to use Hadoop\/Spark. But for the love of God, don't spend 3 months configuring your own Hadoop cluster. Is fun (I've done it), but is just not worth it. Familiarize yourself with plug and play systems like ElasticMapReduce (Amazon), HDInsight (Microsoft Azure), Cloudera or Hortonworks. They have all the tools you might need afterwards (NIFI, Storm, etc). \n\n- Learn how to setup and administer at least one SQL database and a non-SQL type. In a good company you will have a data engineer that will do that for you, but is always nice to know what the hell is happening.\n\n- Don't try to understand and be fluent in every single tool available, learn the tools when you need to use them. I can't tell you how much time I've lost learning tools that I never used.\n\n**Languages**\n\n- DS is not art, you do not need beautiful languages like Haskell or be fluent in Design Patterns. DS is ugly hacking most of the time.\n\n- As a followup learn Python or R, both are languages where hacking is rather easy and straightforward and have plenty of ways to interact with popular Big Data paradigms.\n\n**Background**\n\n- Learn math, really, you won't become a Data Scientist just because you know SQL and a bit of Python. Many times, the problem needs a not so obvious tool, and just using a demo algorithm from sklearn won't solve the problem.\n\n- Before using an algorithm, be sure which function it is optimizing. You wouldn't use linear regression for classification, right? Why? Because both have different objective functions, and are optimizing different stuff.\n\n- Really, really, don't just plug and play algorithms. We are not there yet.\n\n- Start with simple models, and if they don't work move to more complex things. Data Science is not research, we are not competing to have the best accuracy, many times, the client doesn't give a shit about accuracy, just that their problem is solved. Honestly, unless you are Google or Facebook, your problems can be probably solved without using DeepLearning.\n\n- On that note, don't jump steps. Don't start trying to do DeepLearning if you don't know other algorithms like SVMs or Logistic Regression.

Do you like your jobs? Any advice for me?","DataScience","So, I supposedly work for the \"best place to work\" in my city due to a positive culture, pay, work\/life balance, etc etc. But, the culture around data science is not very fun, maybe even toxic. The company dates back to the late 1800s-early 1900s and the average tenure is over 15 years so, it is so slow to change and largely run by, what I call, \"intestinal analytics.\" I can't really afford to leave right now because I made the mistake of living at my means and I have plenty of debt to pay down before I can move, maybe a year and a half longer before I can afford a pay cut without dramatically decreasing my standard of living, which takes a bit of time to liquidate assets anyhow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey hired our entire team over the course of one year. We are a team of 12 and I am one of 6 Data Scientists. I was initially hired due to my abilities in R. I did some of the advanced modeling work for a while, which I enjoyed. After a few months, the higher ups decided to purchase tableau. I was the only one of the team with prior tableau experience so, I got moved over to tableau world. At first, that was fine because I had to refresh my memory and relearn a lot of things as well as train another team member. Now, it's tedious and boring. So, now, it's me and a coworker who live in tableau world. The bad part is less the boringness and more so the fact that we are responsible for facing the company and building something presentable out of the modeling work that others can understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, the models show that the company is losing ground in comparison to competitors, which, for some reason, we get yelled at over, because \"the modeling can't be correct.\" It is. They just don't like it. Keep in mind, the profit margin for this company is over 60% so, it's a bunch a spoiled old people who throw temper tantrums when they hear things they don't like. Another thing is that when we do roll out a very useful tool or valuable information, that's appreciated for about 15 seconds, then we get bombarded with requests to change colors to different colors based upon the person and no one is happy because they don't have their own individual view.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe culture attitude towards my one coworker and I has also been on a steady decline since the company decided on a \"salary transparency policy\" about a month ago. During a reorg, I got a 25k increase, that I thought everyone else got. Apparently that isn't the case. Only my cowroker who also works primarily with Tableau did as well. Once that got out, she and I have faced a steady stream of judgement because we are making more money to do what is seen as easier. HR issued a statement saying that we got the increase due to the business facing nature and value tableau reports are adding to the company. Either way, it has been uncomfortable, especially when we need their help on something and since we are the youngest on the team.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy coworker who works with me on tableau lives the next street over so we carpool a lot and she spends most of her commute home crying about how much she hates her job.

"],["If you've been wondering about the disappearance of data from our federal databases, here's an excerpt from Michael Lewis' The Fifth Risk which explains what is going on.","DataScience","\n> After Trump took office, DJ Patil watched with wonder as the data disappeared across the federal government. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior removed from their websites the links to climate change data. The USDA removed the inspection reports of businesses accused of animal abuse by the government. The new acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, said he wanted to end public access to records of consumer complaints against financial institutions. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, statistics that detailed access to drinking water and electricity in Puerto Rico were deleted from the FEMA website. In a piece for FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher pointed out that the first annual crime report released by the FBI under Trump was missing nearly three-quarters of the data tables from the previous year. \u201cAmong the data missing from the 2016 report is information on arrests, the circumstances of homicides (such as the relationships between victims and perpetrators), and the only national estimate of annual gang murders,\u201d they wrote. Trump said he wanted to focus on violent crime, and yet was removing the most powerful tool for understanding it.\n\n> \n> And as for the country\u2019s first chief data scientist\u2014well, the Trump administration did not show the slightest interest in him. \u201cI basically knew that these guys weren\u2019t going to listen to us,\u201d said DJ, \u201cso we created these exit memos. The memos showed that this stuff pays for itself a thousand times over.\u201d He hoped the memos might give the incoming administration a sense of just how much was left to be discovered in the information the government had collected. There were questions crying out for answers: for instance, what was causing the boom in traffic fatalities? The Department of Transportation had giant pools of data waiting to be searched. One hundred Americans were dying every day in car crashes. The thirty-year trend of declining traffic deaths has reversed itself dramatically. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said DJ. \u201cDistracted driving? Heavier cars? Faster driving? More driving? Bike lanes?\u201d\n> \n\n> The knowledge to be discovered in government data might shift the odds in much of American life. You could study the vaccination data, for instance, and create heat maps for disease. \u201cIf you could randomly drop someone with measles somewhere in the United States, where would you have the biggest risk of an epidemic?\u201d said DJ. \u201cWhere are epidemics waiting to happen? These questions, when you have access to data, you can do things. Everyone is focused on how data is a weapon. Actually, if we don\u2019t have data, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d\n> \n\n> His memos were never read, DJ suspects. At any rate, he\u2019s never heard a peep about them. And he came to see there was nothing arbitrary or capricious about the Trump administration\u2019s attitude toward public data. Under each act of data suppression usually lay a narrow commercial motive: a gun lobbyist, a coal company, a poultry company. \u201cThe NOAA webpage used to have a link to weather forecasts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was highly, highly popular. I saw it had been buried. And I asked: Now, why would they bury that?\u201d Then he realized: the man Trump nominated to run NOAA thought that people who wanted a weather forecast should have to pay him for it. There was a rift in American life that was now coursing through American government. It wasn\u2019t between Democrats and Republicans. It was between the people who were in it for the mission, and the people who were in it for the money.\n\nHere we are in a golden era of data analysis technique, tools, and theory, and they took away the data. "],["I hire data scientists - this is the stuff this forum doesn't discuss enough...:","DataScience","Hi,\n\nI put a post up a week or so ago about how I hire some junior data scientists - I was actually struggling because I usually hire more senior positions. \n&nbsp;\n\nI got some *great* feedback - and thank you to everyone who commented. At the time though, I put up a comment saying that I felt that this subreddit, and others like the ML one, while great at covering SOME of the area's in data science, left gaps in other area's that really matter in real world scenarios.  I said I would write something about it.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI wrote an obscenely long post about it, and then it didn't post properly (operator error). So, rather than re-type that essay, I thought I would do something at a higher level and then answer questions.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nLets set some context first.\nI work in private industry - a big(ish) UK financial services company. I do a mix of internal R&D type work - stuff our own teams ask for - and stuff that clients ask for. So - everything that follows is in that context - it is a bit different if your working for a start up company. It is very different if your working in acedemia. It's very different if your working for government agencies. Keep that in mind.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI think this forum is awesome - I lurk every day. However, there is stuff that makes up the majority of my life and my guys life that doesn't get discussed here which - as there are so many people posting about moving into this world, and looking for jobs in this world - I think is an issue.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHere are some things which I think need to be discussed here more. Also - if you can show me this stuff on a CV or in an interview, it will jump you straight to the top of the pile. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**1) You are ridiculously expensive - show me how you will add value.**\nThere is a team in every private company that all other departments fear and dread. They are called \"Finance\" and they are the bane of every managers life. They apply basic mathematics in bizarre ways, and they will constantly demand that managers either spend more or less money than they are. The managers will NEVER win.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to head count it boils down to profit margin. Lets say I am recruiting for a senior data scientist and will pay then $100,000 ( really - thats a bit on the low side, but it makes a simple calculation). Lets say my company runs at a 20% profit margin. In the world of Finance, this means that that person needs to add $500,000 of value- not $100,000 -  before they break even. You may think this is crazy - but that is because you are a mere mortal and do not know Finance Maths. You don't have to agree with it - you just have to live with it.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat does that mean for you the data guy? You need to **Get Stuff Done**. You probably aren't going to be getting your own sales leads and doing your own deals - but you need to add value. And that really means ***BEING PRAGMATIC***\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome work needs to be *absolutely* perfect. These are the places where you spend the extra week tweaking your model for that last .1% of accuracy. It's where you are expected to go read papers to find a new clustering algorithm that will reduce the over-fit by .5% and you get a month to try it and deal with it.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut - a lot of stuff doesn't need perfection. If you need to join two sets of data as a one off task, then it doesn't matter if you use SAS, a lump of PERL, bookmarks in TextPad, Excel, Python. No one cares - you just need to get it done. If you need to know whether two elements of data correlate, then often a basic regression is \"good enough\", and will save you a couple of hours.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n*What does this mean?*\nYou'll know which hat you need to wear - but when you're wearing your \"just get it done\" hat - which will be more often than your \"Get it perfect\" hat - you need to a toolbag full of quick work arounds and practical methods. If something takes 100 lines of SAS, 10 lines of Python or 2 lines of Perl... don't go the SAS route. If you need to eyeball and juggle 10,000 records then you could drop it out as a set of tables with R, or you could do it in Excel. I know it's not cool - but finance don't care - so your manager doesn't - so you don't. Get good at this stuff. Be pragmatic. Know when to have a \"Good enough\" mentality. And show it.....\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**2) Learn to deal with junk**\nReal world data is, usually, rubbish. You need to be *REALLY* good at dealing with rubbish.\nExamples - I have about 2 petabytes of data coming from about 8,000 sources. The absolute best raw data set has a 2% error rate. The worst has a 75% error rate. Those figures are better than a lot of other groups are dealing with. You don't get to complain or get someone else to clean it up - you need to be good at adapting to it. REALLY REALLY REALLY good.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThat data comes in to me in perhaps 1500 schemas and formats. No provider - ever - sticks to a schema. EVER. *EVER!* So, I need to be able to join data that arrived in EBSDIC to stuff that turns up in weirdly compressed AVRO. (tip here - learn to love CSV - it's a perfect intermediate - as is an SQLite table). Looking across my data sets, I can see a minimum of 21 different data structures for Date:Time. What ever your going to do, your going to use dates and times. So - thats something you need to be slick with. Remember Point 1) - this is \"Get It Done\" stuff. \n&nbsp;\n\n\nAlso - a lot of data science is speculative - your going to have 10 idea's for every 1 actual piece of solid work you do. For those idea's, you're usually going to need to crash a data sample together, give it an eyeballing, patch it up a bit, do some basic work and see if it's practical. That means 9 out of 10 of those tasks you do will be disposable - so just Get It Done.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAll of this is probably best described as \"Data Monkeying\" - your not doing science - your monkeying with data. Realistically over the course of a year, you will probably spend 50% of your time doing Data Monkey work rather than real Data Science. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n*What does that mean?*\nWhen i recruit a data scientist, they absolutely, completely and totally MUST be damn good data monkeys. I'm counting on you being able to do the data monkeying in 50% of your day, not 90% of your day, so that the other 50% of your day you can do the \"Data Science\" bit and actually add value - cos the Finance Team are watching...\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIt's not cool, you don't get a conference speech out of it, and it doesn't get you a bonus, but unless you are dealing with a single source of data, a good deal of your life is going to be spent dealing with this mess. You need to 1) get good at it and 2) not take too long dealing with it.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIf I had god like powers over this Sub I would make it so that 50% or more of the posts are people trading tips, cookbooks, idea's and lots of practice data sets so they are getting good at data monkeying, rather than Data Science. Definitely less cool - but will make the biggest impact to your working lives.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSome examples of data monkeying: Flicking between data structures and schemas. Recasting data. parsing data. Changing time series - compressing and interpolation of time events -Spliting data. Joining data. Dealing with common types of tricky data - like names, address structures, dates, time series. blah blah blah.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFastest way to get your CV to the top of the pile - make sure that I can see your data monkeying as well as your data science skills.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**3) Learn to tell a story and not be scary.**\nYour going to work with all sorts of people - Sales, IT, Operations and lots of managers. And you will intimidate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. Whether you are or not actually scary, when you walk into a room, they will automatically assume that you are the brightest person in that room and that your going to baffle them. \n&nbsp;\n\n\nSome people - a minority - will try and get close to you and learn from you. The vast majority will react to their intimidation by either not listening to you at all ( many managers ) or feeling annoyed by you ( most sales people). It's not anyone's fault - it's just human nature. If you break out the big words, the jargon, the acronyms and present them with a 19 page excel spreadsheet you do nothing but reinforce those pre-conceptions. Downside for you is that it's harder to rapidly climb the career ladder. Downside for your boss is that it's harder for you to show 5x or 20x your salary as value - which means more discussions with Finance ( shudder)\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n*Two easy fixes and one sneaky fix:*\n**Fix 1** - Learn to tell a story. Seriously - when you tell people about your work give it a beginning, a middle and an end. \"I was asked X, I did A, B, C and D, it looks like the answer is Y\". You might not need to do this for people for people who read this sub, but this is humanising you. Another thing - put it in context ... I.e. \"A client has X as a problem... I did A, B, C and D. It looks like the answer is Y because it helps the client due to....blah blah blah..\"\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**fix 2** - present in the right way for the audience.\nSome people can deal with lots of data. Some people insist on it. Some people are intimiated by it. Some people genuinely see it as you trying to hide behind a snow of nonsense.  For example - if your doing something for a finance group, or a bunch of actuaries - you NEED the 19 page spreadsheet. And you'd better be damn sure every single cell is correct. If you were presenting to a senior sales manager, then you want a few pages of Powerpoint with big diagrams and a few bullets per page maximum. Thats not because the sales guy is less clever - it's just what they need to consume information. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou don't need to be a graphic designer - but you do need an acceptable grasp of displaying data. Reading FlowingData. Read blogs. Practice. Learn to make an acceptable spreadsheet. Learn to make an acceptable PowerPoint. Play with MathPlotLib\/SAS-Graph\/Plotly..... Again - you don't need to be amazing - you don't need to be a master data visualisation expert - \"good enough\" - but that still needs practice.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Sneaky fix:** Remember how you intimidate people because they think your a genius? Ask them a question about something they know - \"What do you think the client will do with this\" or \"How will HR use this data to plan the company party?\". Give them a set of options for something even if you make them up  Doesn't matter what it is - just ask one so they can contribute. Practice doing it subtly.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI think I'm going to run out of words soon - more in the next comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n"],["Academic Torrents - Making 27TB of research data available (including datasets)","DataScience",""],["No science in Data science","DataScience","So...

Really appreciate it.\n\nMy background - Stats undergrad from a rigorous school, no MS or PHD. Got a job as a business analyst, realized I could do more with my skills. \n\nAfter that, I hate to be a cliche but what got me the furthest was projects. Find reasons to get excited about the technology, build projects. Go to hackathons, build projects. Add stuff to your blog, github, etc. There are no MOOCs or blogposts that will get you the experience of actually trying to process and model real data with real data problems.\n\nOnce you do enough of these, you can start to talk data science with other professionals at a level of comfort that signals that you're not bullshitting just to get a job. \n\nOne other piece of advice I have is to push yourself at your current role in the right direction. I realized that while my current job wasn't a data science role, there were non technical things I could do to help become a better data scientist eventually - things like getting really good at SQL queries, building visualizations and focusing on story telling around the data (even just in powerpoint format). \n\nCombining this with the more technical data science related stuff in my own time helped a lot - the business side of data science is underrated but often what employers are really looking for.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to share is that it was not easy, and interviewing is really hard. I was doing several personal projects, built a blog, participated in hackathons, participated in kaggle challenges, going to meetups, linkedin, etc. and I still bombed at the beginning. Doing these things got my foot in the door - I had the opportunity to interview for top companies such as Facebook but I tanked at the beginning. It was embarrassing and humbling - but do not give up! Take interviews whenever you get a chance just to practice those skills and eventually it will become more natural.\n\nThat's all for now, can add more based on interest! \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit #2: Remembered one more thing. There are going to be haters on your journey. People will gatekeep, claim that you're not doing 'real data science', or say the market is overflooded with data scientist wannabes. There's probably some truth there, but I had to keep reminding myself that everyone starts somewhere, and in the end this is just a career choice for now. Not the end of the world - ignore them and keep pressing on.   \n\n"],["A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Data Engineering \u2014 The Series Finale","DataScience","Hi all,\n\nData engineering is a very important field, but it is new, often under-appreciated, and rarely discussed relative to its close cousin Data Science.

The Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization was a great way to get myself introduced into the world of data science, and the further I got through the course, the more I felt like I wanted to do this for a living. And I managed to pull that off! The only downside is that R is my specialty, and I currently work in a predominately Python atmosphere. So I thought what better way to spruce up my Python techniques than taking some more Coursera courses, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, to my dismay, the University of Michigan's Data Science with Python classes are a disorganized mess. The professors clearly haven't updated things in the course for years. The videos had errors galore, there were errors in the assignments that we were given, and the notes were filled with outdated code that has been done away with since Python has been updated. It's one thing to encourage users to hop on the discussion forum for better learning and discussion between peers and professionals, but I found the discussion forum was just filled with ways to get around the errors that the instructors left behind for the user to deal with. While these were not meant to be courses in Python debugging, they turned out to be that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to make a long story short, if you're interested in learning Python for data science, I can not recommend these courses. This is not to say that everything on Coursera is garbage. As I mentioned, the Johns Hopkins classes arguably got me the job I have today. But if you're jumping in to these ideas for the first time, the University of Michigan does not make data science a fun subject to learn. Instead, they turn it into a specialization of jumping through hoops to get a certification, and needless to say, that's not how people learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you've had better experiences in other courses, please comment below to help fellow readers out!

How, if at all, can these traits be learned or acquired?\"**\n\n\nPanelist Answers:\n_______________________________________________________\n\/u\/creampuffcrusader:\n\nThe best data scientists I've worked with had these two traits:\n\n**A deeply rooted paranoia about data quality.**\n\nStarting out a project by trying to replicate KPIs and current domain knowledge before jumping into the new and exciting work. Talking to stewards of the data about any quirks they ran into and taking the time to understand the data generating process. This can be learned either from mentor-ship or from experience. For me personally - it was combination of both mentorship and collecting battle scars.\n\n**Holding themselves to the scientific method***\n\nI had a mentor who was a data scientist before it was cool. He started the quantitative supply chain practice at the firm I work in back when the data scientist equivalent position was called Principal Analyst. He had this motto when interviewing stakeholders:\n\nTribal knowledge is a hypothesis unless there is evidence.\nHe had this uncanny ability of organizing knowledge by what has been verified, what can be verified, and what is interesting but maybe out of scope or not testable. And using this categorization to efficiently guide us to a quality analysis or product. Really - he was just very strictly holding himself and his team to the scientific method. It was remarkable.\n\nThis trait can definitely be learned. But it takes patience and experience.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\/u\/amadeusmagrabi:\n\nIn my experience, the best data scientists are the ones who have **an intrinsic drive to deliver value for the business** and are **able to think outside the box to make sure that the whole team has the highest impact.**\n\nGood data scientists ask their manager what the project requirements are, do their research, deliver a clean and thorough analysis, communicate their most important findings clearly and then ask what they should work on next.\n\nGreat data scientists take a more active approach and think about their work with more context. They ask what the larger goal of the project is and challenge the core assumptions. They have ideas for how a project could also benefit other parts of the company or raise awareness for potential conflicts that could occur down the line. They are informed about new frameworks or techniques that come out and suggest innovative ways how they could be used to improve a process. They are genuinely interested in how the business as a whole works and actively talk to people to understand their perspectives. They are full of ideas of what they should work on next. They pride themselves on how many people they helped and not on how complicated the technique they used was.\n\nImportantly, they do all of this because they care about the impact of their work and not because they want the attention or boost their career. They do not start a discussion just for the sake of having a discussion and they are able to step back when their opinions did not resonate with others.\n\n*As to how to acquire these skills:* \n\nIf you do not have a data science job yet, this is hard to prepare. But it helps to read blog posts in which companies from different industries share how they get value out of their data (there are plenty of those on Medium).\n\nOnce you have a job, ask as many questions as possible without being too annoying and talk to everyone in the company. Do not be shy and just sit in front of your data. Constantly ask yourself why you are doing what you are doing, if it still makes sense or if there is a better way. Get involved, be curious and let others know about your thoughts. The more feedback you get on your thoughts, the better you can fine-tune your work to the business context.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\/u\/tsutomu45\n \nThis depends on the role of the data scientist and the company.\n\nIn a tech company where seconds (and milliseconds) matter, then your knowledge of algorithms, statistical learning, and programming matters a lot.\n\nHowever, if you're in a non-tech company, where data scientists tend to be more \"decision scientists\", and the transactions happen across days or weeks (think buying a car), then the \"soft-skills\" tend to dominate...things like understanding the business, iterating rapidly, and explaining results to non-math\/non-engineering executives.\n\nBoth are learn-able. However, in my experience the latter (soft skills) are harder to teach.\n_______________________________________________________\n\/u\/dfphd:\n\nThere are three things that come to mind:\n\n* **They are driven by outcomes and not methods - but can do either well.** \n\nThe best data scientists I've met are the people that are willing to put their ego aside and cobble together a less elegant answer in two days than a more elegant answer in a week because that's what's right for the project. That's not to say that they cannot put together a complex, elegant solution to a problem - when the problem\/project calls for it, they can roll their sleeves up and make that happen. But their bias is for getting results, not getting methodologies.\n\n* **They say \"yes\" more often than \"no\"**\n\nIt's really easy to say no. We can't do that, that can't be done, that won't work, no, no, no. Really good data scientists say yes - knowing that they may need to change the question for it to work, but understanding that they can likely figure something productive out.\n\n* **They build strong relationships based on work credibility**\n\nThese people tend to do more than just be good at their job - they seem to always manage to leverage the quality of their work into really strong relationships at work, which in turn helps them be even more effective by having a lot of people who are willing to go to bat for them when needed. I think the first two attributes tend to help in building these relationships, but there is extra effort and time that they dedicate to cultivate these relationships over time.\n\nLearning these skills, in my opinion, is largely driven by introspection, i.e., identifying that your objective should be to become as effective and efficient as possible, and that you may need to modify your behaviors, your habits, your comfort zone in order to become that person. Once you can legitimately convince yourself that these are skills worth developing, the rest becomes an exercise in keeping yourself honest - in constantly call yourself out when you are being a method-diva, when you're being a naysayer, and when you're marginalizing your relationships at work."],["AI apocalypse","DataScience",""],["How JetBlue keeps fares low","DataScience",""],["Any examples of hobby Data Science projects that could earn you some side income?","DataScience","What are the examples of Data Science\/ML projects, for example, external API's, recommender systems that you could build on your own to put on your portfolio and also help you make some side-income (through ads?)?\n\nI'm not talking about the Kaggle-type predictions problems but ML projects that you actually deploy and run to serve some purpose.

A presentation was scheduled for the first day I was off on a 2-week vacation. When I came back, I notice that all my exhibits that didn\u2019t support the desired result had been removed. At that point I was sort of over the whole thing. They still didn\u2019t convince anyone that it was a good idea. People asked about methodology and what was missing, and they had to admit that it didn\u2019t support the conclusion. It was decided that the desired action wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\n\nThat said, there are a number of managers who still think it will be a good idea.

Document your methodology and be transparent!! My work was combed over thoroughly by many people who were hoping I\u2019d done it wrong. I was very detailed and clear in my documentation. I kept a research notebook, commented code, and and made everything reproducible. This helped support my point. Just the fact that I was extra transparent (more than others on my team) gave me a lot more credence.\n\n2. Don\u2019t be confrontational. Let the data do the talking. I think I ended up looking better than I might have because I didn\u2019t argue my point. I just put the data out there and it did the talking for me.\n\n3. Know when to walk away. This wasn\u2019t worth making a big deal about. I resigned myself to do what I had to do to finish the project and move on. But I\u2019m looking to move on to a new company. I lost a lot of respect for some higher up people. Worse, I think people are rewarded more for political reasons than for adding value. I don\u2019t want to spend my career playing politics. So I\u2019m going to find something else. (If anyone is hiring data analysts in the DC area, feel free to PM me.)\n\n\n\nOriginal post:\n\nUsing a burner account since a couple work people know my normal username.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing more-or-less data science work for about two years at a very large, very established company. You would know the name if I mentioned it. I do some modeling but, honestly, most people just want graphs and tables of particular things they suspect would lead to something profitable.The requests are often something like, \u201cHey, I think there may be a relationship to XYZ and decreased customer churn. Can you throw together some views for me?\u201d  The higher up you go, the less people trust fancy models that they can\u2019t understand. They want a nice scatter plot that makes it obvious. And I get that. You gotta sell an idea somehow.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve started working on more high profile projects. One project started about 9 months ago and required getting a large data set from a vendor. This took months. In the meantime, more and more high level people started talking about it. The idea of the project was to show that action X would reduce customer churn. This was pretty much assumed to be true, and the analysis was necessary to figure out how much of action X, when, and how much benefit we could expect.\n\nPeople got excited about this. SVPs we\u2019re checking in on the status, anxiously awaiting the benefits. When planning for next year, many tacitly assumes this would bring a boost to overall sales and would help them meet more aggressive targets.\n\nThe only problem is they\u2019re all wrong. We got the data and I\u2019ve been crunching it for a month now. No matter how you model it, graph it, slice or dice it, this relationship they assumed existed doesn\u2019t. Now the supervisor on the project is freaking out. We spent a lot of time on this and a lot of money on the data. People expect to see at least some kind of result. This morning, I was told that \u201cwe have to deliver what they expect, even in a small way. We can\u2019t just say there\u2019s nothing here worthwhile.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m expected to manufacture results that simply aren\u2019t real. I don\u2019t feel very comfortable with that. And since this started, I\u2019ve noticed that similar problems are not uncommon. People use analyses based on sparse data and unsound conclusions to make convenient decisions. It seems like an unspoken fact that when someone higher up wants to see something you more or less find a way to show that to them. Doing so will get you noticed and promoted. Fussing about statistical significance and data credibility will just annoy people. If I had to guess I\u2019d say 25% and maybe up to 50% (depending on the director) of our conclusions lack credibility. None of these decisions hurt people or customers; they really just lose us money. But still.\n\nI already know not finding something in this project will negatively affect me\u2014whether it be my performance rating or passed up for promotion. It\u2019s really stressing me out.

About 7 months ago I decided I needed a career change due to a number of reasons.  Working as a Mechanical Engineer was not fulfilling anymore and I started to hear more about Data Science and Machine Learning.  I've always had a passion for performing data analyses but never really considered it more than a responsibility of my various positions.  After looking more into the field of Data Science, I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn everything I could in this field.  \n\nI started with a subscription to Datacamp.com and worked my way through the Data Scientist Track with R path.  In addition, I took some courses on Coursera (Machine Learning with Andrew Ng) and EdX (Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science).  I exposed myself to some Kaggle competitions and went to a few local Data Science meetups.  These were great opportunities to network and speak with other Data Scientists\/Analysts to see what they were working on and brush up on skills that would look great on my resume.  Ultimately, I focused on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn), R, and SQL.  The above courses are great for getting your toes wet and introducing you to the basics.  Also, keep looking at r\/datascience and reading of others success stories, they have some great roadmaps!\n\nWith my skill-set quickly growing, I began applying to jobs about 3 months ago.  Anyone who's been through the application process before will know that this is a painstakingly slow process so whatever you do, don't give up and keep applying!  I applied anywhere and everywhere that had a position that sounded interesting.  Most importantly, I was applying for positions I thought I could eventually do, not just the ones that I could do now.  All the while, still working on my skills through any free courses I could find.\n\nUp until about 3 weeks ago, I was getting very few responses to my applications with even less interviews.  Although discouraging, I didn't give up.  I have to throw a big thanks to my friends, and most particularly my roommates for keeping me going through this process.  The single biggest change through this process occurred after my roommate suggested I update my resume.  Not just the content, but the format and look too.  I reluctantly took this advice and spent a few hours crafting multiple revisions until I got something that I was happy with the result.\n\nAfter updating my resume and applying to a few new jobs, my responses skyrocketed, I couldn't believe it (I fully intend to create a time series of this whole process BTW).  I went from next to no interviews to multiple phone calls in a single day and multiple in-person interviews in a week.  Full disclosure, it takes more than a pretty resume to extend the interview process so obviously it helps to understand the content.  \n\nI quickly managed to talk my way into a few interviews and I now landed my first job offer with another two interviews finishing up shortly!

Companies really need to do a better job of screening the people they allow to conduct interviews. \n\nSo the situation was that I was in an interview process with big company that has a big AI group. I finished my second phone screen two days ago. The first one went really well. I really liked the person. I answered all of their technical questions and I received an email that they wanted to move forward.\n\nThe second guy was pretty weird. He didn't introduce himself, and I had to stop him to ask his name. He then proceeds to ask me about the one non machine learning project on my resume. I start to tell him about it, and he asks \n\n\"Well do you have any ML experience? Because we do a lot of that here.\"\n\nWell then maybe you should ask me about the three other ML projects on my resume which you clearly didn't read until you asked me that question. I then started to tell him about one of the ML projects on my resume. He asks a few questions in that annoying way, where interviewers try to poke holes in your work to try to through you off balance. I'm thinking \"Dude I worked on this for a year. I know what I'm talking about.\" I answer his questions and he seems satisfied.\n\nHe then asks me a few basic ML questions (e.g. explain linear regression and SVMs). I easily answer those. He asks me a coding question, which I also easily answer. Throughout this whole time he's challenging me by asking questions on things that he clearly doesn't understand that well. He tried poking holes in my solutions, usually by saying things that we're just wrong, which led me having correct his understanding of basic things (e.g. What is a random variable). I try my best to do it politely as possible.\n\nHe then says that he doesn't have anymore questions and if there's anything I want to ask him. I ask a few basic questions about the company, and we call it a day.\n\nI get feedback today that they're not moving forward because of my lack of knowledge of NLP. Dude didn't even ask me about NLP. If he did he would know I'm pretty freaking knowledgable about it. We ended the interview 15 minutes early, which I don't maybe he could have used to ask me about NLP if it's so important. \n\nWhat's really frustrating to me about this is the AI group there is really large and the fact that I had a problem with this interviewer doesn't mean I wouldn't fit. In other situations I would just say \"Well at least I don't have to work with him.\" But from talking to the other guy, I think I would have actually fit in really well there, and I just had bad luck by getting this one guy as an interviewer.\n\nAnyway I guess there's not much I can do.

Each problem progressively builds on the concepts of the previous problems, with increasing complexity through a few well-defined learning paths through the tech tree.  Content is kept current\/in pace state of the art by community submissions and a committee of qualified curators.\n\n**\/tl;dr**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBackground on me:  I'm an engineer who made a feeble jump to 'citizen data science' in 2017.  sum total of my education are the courses at fast.ai, by \/u\/jeremyhoward .  I'm a programmer, not a math PhD (which is why the fast.ai courses appealed to me).  I also have a background in developing IT curriculum, which is why I am posting this. \n\nAnd, I'm *quite sure* that the 'how do you get started in Data Science' question has too many answers out there, and none of them are great.   I'll hack a quote together, stolen from [Paul Lockhart](https:\/\/www.maa.org\/external_archive\/devlin\/LockhartsLament.pdf) and reworded to be relevant to this problem (**bold** are my edits):\n\n> our present system of **data science** education is precisely this kind of nightmare. In\n> fact, if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a **person's** natural\n> curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn\u2019t possibly do as good a job as is currently being\n> done\u2014 I simply wouldn\u2019t have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soulcrushing\n> ideas that constitute contemporary **data science** education.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here's are the problems I see with the current state:**\n\n* Too many (very convincing) answers out there to the 'how to get started' question. (blog posts, moocs, reddit threads, etc).\n* The answers are typically incomplete due to the *individual* biases of those answering.\n* The answers, (and those recommending them after the fact) begin to become stale vs. state-of-the-art the *moment* they are posted.  (e.g. are we seriously still recommending the 2011 Ng course?)\n* Most of the learning path recommendations are too frontloaded w formal math\/stats heavy for the people typically asking it. Someone who is considering a bona fide Data Science education will *not* need to ask 'how do I get started in Data Science'.  They need help finding a degree program.  Most people asking this question *really* want to become citizen data scientists (bu they don't know it yet).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is what I envision:**\n\n* A canonical, open source, community driven project maintained in GitHub.\n* The content is designed around a **very specific** framework that enforces some core concepts:\n    * **problem based:**  Imagine a 'tech tree' of canonical ML\/DL problems that represent the center of gravity of *high value* ML\/DL methods and techniques.  Like [this](http:\/\/www.saedsayad.com\/data_mining_map.htm), with one problem per domain, and maybe only 20-30 problems total in the tech tree at any given time.\n    * **continuously updated:** Continuous improvements are submitted by the community, and curated by a small committee of qualified maintainers, who are curating around a well-define set of criteria.  New problems and accompanying lessons are submitted in a standard format (see below) via pull request \n    * **progressive**: crawl, walk run.  Learning paths always start with the 'hello world' ML examples, and have a few progressive learning paths defined that define 2-3 different journeys through that tech tree, where each subsequent problem builds on principles learned in those before it.  Problems increase in difficulty\/complexity as the learner progresses through the chosen learning path.\n    * **practical**: learners are writing code and solving problems as a first principle, with real data from the first step, and every subsequent step.  Humans learn by playing the whole game.  (Read David Perkins, [Making Learning Whole](https:\/\/www.gse.harvard.edu\/news\/uk\/09\/01\/education-bat-seven-principles-educators))\n    * **inclusive:**  This is not intended to be a replacement or comparable to a formal Data Science degree program.  The truth is, a formal DS education is *simply not* a prerequisite to using computers and code to answer questions about data, and to understanding how those answers are derived.\n    * **emphasizes math:**  The goal isn't to 'cirucumvent' a formal math education, it's to sprinkle it in judiciously along the way, instead of making it a prerequisite.  e.g. hello world problems will branch off to teach the actual math behind linear regression.  When SGD s introduced, we will branch off to teach the actual math behind SGD.  Every problem should be accompanied by a new practical math component that is given nearly as much emphasis as the problem solving\/coding.\n    * **standardized:**  The learning content for a 'problem' has a well defined and consistent standard:  Problem statement, sample data, solution criteria, list of principles introduced, a math concept, etc.  The format of problem\/lesson submissions is a Jupyter notebook with a step-by-step walkthrough of the problem and solution.  Bonus points for embedding a YT video walkthrough in the notebooks.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThoughts?  Feedback?  Anybody want to help?

I'm recruiting for software developers specifically, but I'm guessing that my experience is relevant for Data Science as well.\n\nI've seen several threads recently debating the merits\/importance of the actual job title \"Data Scientist.\"  I've commented something to the effect of: I don't think it's the most important thing in the world, but I also don't think it's meaningless.   \nSo I'd like to give some insight as to where I think it does and doesn't matter.\n\nIn my current role at \"large tech company,\" I source resumes from an internal database based on whatever logic my imagination can come up with.  I might choose to search for \"software developer\" or I might choose to search for \"java OR c++ OR scalability OR service oriented architecture\" - in other words, I can search for job titles if I want, or I can search for key words \/ skillsets.  The reality is that it's not lost on recruiters that job titles can be highly variable, so more often than not, we're looking for the skillsets \/ the keywords we expect to represent them.  So that's how we find resumes and get you into the whole coding test, phone screen, etc process.  So the next question is: how does your job title affect salary should you receive an offer?  At my company it flat out doesn't.  The salary ranges are set internally based on the job we're recruiting for.  There's room for negotiation and exceptions and all of that, but that's a conversation that happens so far down the line that the real technical folks already have a good understanding of who you are.  So I can say with confidence that: 1) recruiters know there is variability in job titles, but usually have a more specific idea of what skills they're looking for and adjust their strategies accordingly, and 2) it really doesn't affect your salary if you're hired.  So in the context of a large tech company with recruiters sourcing for candidates, the job title is not that important.  If you don't have the actual job title \"Data Scientist\" then just make sure that you write \"Data Science\" somewhere on your resume just in case.\n\nNow let me tell you where I think the job title might actually matter: at smaller companies that don't have sophisticated recruiting operations.  I've worked at a start up where literally the founder of the company found me on LinkedIn directly. And I can almost guarantee that he found me simply by searching for \"Data Science + <city>.\"  Now, it's possible that in those search results he found people with the actual job title \"Data Scientist\" but also people who just have Data Science mentioned in their profile.  It's hard to say what heuristics he used to filter down those results, but I have to imagine this is something that really changes on a case to case basis.  If I'm looking to hire someone, questions I might ask myself are - do I need an experienced Data Scientist? can I just train an aspiring Data Scientist instead?  All of those types of considerations affect what someone looking to hire for a Data Science role is going to do and there are too many possibilities to generalize on the importance or lack thereof of the title.  The answer is definitely maybe!\n\nThe last consideration that I'd like to address is how the job title pertains to perceptions of career progression and seniority.  That's definitely something recruiters look for when they're hiring for non entry level positions.  But from my experience so far, I think that if you have the appropriate years of relevant experience, an odd looking career progression might get noticed and asked about later on, but I think it's less likely to be used as a reason to screen you out early in the process.  \n\nI could go an ad nauseam, but I think I'll just end this here.

Enrolled in a data science masters program, and I'm quitting","DataScience","Since I guess we're on the topic I'll share my story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017 June. I'm a software engineer with about 5 years experience, a publication in data vis, and a physics\/math bachelors who spends a lot of time reading books and studying math, physics, and computer science. I pretty much self taught myself enough programming to make a great income, but spent a lot of time thinking I might be interested in a research role at a company not necessarily working on product and being a slave to release cycles. In my self teaching, I've pretty much went through SICP, Cormen, an Automata Book, ISL, Casella and Berger, and even an analysis of algorithms using combinatorics. I'm not a big fan of R so I learn enough python to get by, but don't deep dive because I already have a healthy full-stack dev job in javascript land where I get paid a ton making web apps that are just wrappers for prediction algorithms. Yet every interview no one would take me seriously in interviews to jump onto a team because of \"lack of experience in the field\". Completely open-ended and ambiguous questions using technologies I don't use in my day to day would hang me up every time. SQL optimization? Some obscure function closure in R? I'd get asked it and drop the ball on an interview. By the way, I also get vetted by software engineers and marketing teams. \"You don't know Google AdWords?\" Mind you these interviews are offering almost $20K less than what I make now, because I don't fall into the \"experienced\" category of job applicants and I'm \"entry level\". So I get an idea, since I'm reading all this stuff and I feel like I know enough to get by:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's do a data science masters!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy experience is as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA pre-requisite class introductory programming in Java because as a physics\/math major with 5 years of experience, granted in javascript, cannot possibly learn how to program. It's super fun to spend $4k to learn a type system in Java that I already know since I've used Haskell. Lovely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond class, masters level algorithms class which is the first actual class in the program Useful, but we're just going over Cormen et. al. Which I already read. Another $4K down the drain. By the way, my employer isn't paying for this so this is my cash. Granted there was some stuff I glanced over in the first reading like bipartite graph algorithms and getting an idea of max flow, but the rest of the class was cut and dry simple. Mind you I'm paying $4k to fill a hole in my knowledge that could be filled with a Medium post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird Class, masters level statistics class. Useful, but we're just going over the stuff in Casella and Berger. A useful but expensive rehash of all the flavors of distributions and hypothesis testing for all of them. Another $4k down the drain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm done. My next class would be a review of ISL. Do I need another expensive hand-holding through a book I already read? Shall we discuss confusion matrices and how to construct trees for another $4k? I'm just not doing it. The other set of classes are in databases and optimization. I can read that stuff on my own. There would have been a total of 10 classes at $4K each, so I'm just not setting myself back $40K to apply to jobs that I'll be underqualified for anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then I got a job at a business that focuses on being a tool for data scientists so we have then on-staff as well as sell directly to data science teams, where I do full-stack engineering building the product as a software engineer who knows enough stats + data science to build the product. I'm learning that right now data scientist jobs are gatekept, and rightly so, by people who are spending a lot of money on people who are arguably not generating anything on their bottom lines. These stakeholders were already sold on the data-lake ROI that returned nothing, so they're extremely hesitant to invest more in resources in a tech buzz that probably won't actually give them ROI. Keep in mind many of these business don't have any existing resources to get make data scientists productive. It's not alien for data scientists to be hired and they just get pointed to a PostGRES database on AWS, and told \"Here you go.\" The standards for getting hired are extremely high in many positions because they simply can't afford a false-positive hire. Keep in mind they don't know what they want anyways, as evidenced by plenty of stories of data scientists who did get jobs but quickly realized they're a one-man show of smoke and mirrors. Companies want to integrate data science into their strategy to remain competitive, but they have no idea what that means for their business. I've learned no to join this rat race. There are plenty of problems for smart people to work on, and data science doesn't need me. 90% of people are using the technologies to detect smiles, and the other 5% credit loan processing, and 5% marketing. I want to do none of these things. I specifically wanted to join a field where I could use more of my mathematics in my day to day, but I'm not willing to sacrifice more cash and an already well founded career for that. As an experienced software developer I make more than an entry level data scientist, whatever that even means since you need a graduate degree to really get your resume looked at.

If you're considering a bootcamp, and it's partnered with a university, check if it's hosted by Trilogy before enrolling. If it is, stay away.\n\nHi all,\n\nJust wanted to write a quick cautionary post for anyone considering bootcamps as a potential route for getting into the data science field.\n\nI\u2019m a recent graduate with an MS in applied math in December looking for positions as a data analyst \/ scientist. Unfortunately, I wasn't having much luck getting responses. I didn't have any previous internships, as my original plan was to get a PhD, and only ended up getting the MS due to major problems with the school that cropped up halfway through my third semester (a whole other story, though). I had seen a few recommendations for bootcamps on here as a way to break into the field for people with no experience. I noticed that my undergraduate school \"hosted\" one, and figured that it might be a good way to fill in the gap between me graduating and me finally getting a job, and at the very least learn how to implement all of the theory that I had been learning over my degrees. I had some experience in Python from undergrad and from going through some Kaggle tutorials, but figured there had to be something else I was missing since I wasn't getting any responses.\n\nAfter enrolling and paying (way too much) money, I got to the class and learned pretty quickly that the bootcamp wasn't hosted by the university, but rather some company called Trilogy Education Services. Already I felt uneasy about continuing, but figured since I already paid I should stick with it. As the class continued, however, I quickly realized that I had essentially been swindled.\n\nEnrollment: When I submitted my email \/ cell number for an \"I'm interested, tell me more\" link, I started to get daily calls from some employee of Trilogy who I thought was working for the university they were partnered with. Looking back, they were definitely trying to bait me into signing up for the class as soon as possible. There was an entrance exam, meant to screen people out, which was an absolute joke and that I wouldn't be surprised if no one actually does get screened. Some of the golden lines were \"we only have one spot left, and there's a few people I'm talking to that are considering it\" and \"I can't tell you which companies we have at the career days, like if I told you it was <massive company with ties to my city> and they weren't there, you'd be disappointed, but if you knew which companies we were partnered with, you'd be excited\" (these exact lines were also told to my classmates, too!). Red flags were going off at this point for me, but I was scared about having a gap on my resume where I wasn't doing anything, so I ended up taking the bait. Once I finally to the class, after paying, I learned that it was Trilogy hosting the class, and not the university.\n\nCurriculum: All over the place. It's obvious that they come from a webdev bootcamp background. So far it's been: 2 weeks of Excel \/ VBA, 6 weeks of Python (this should be the meat of the course, but everything we covered was so basic that I had already covered it between the single class I had taken and Kaggle tutorials), some relational database stuff (I hadn't even taken a class on this and I knew 90% of the stuff they taught just from spending a week or two on hackerrank SQL questions...), HTML \/ CSS website building (boiled down to copy and pasting lines of bootstrap code), a few random other topics like nonrelational databases (explained poorly, I still don't know when you'd use a relational vs nonrelational other than when you really want joins), some statistics \/ hypothesis testing (explained very incorrectly), and web scraping with beautifulsoup \/ splinter (surprisingly decent, though I knew BS beforehand). Next week we're going into JS, which\u2026 why\u2026 It feels like everything we're learning is solely for visualizing data, when I signed up for the bootcamp (and expressed to the recruiter person) that I was seeking to become a data scientist. We were told that it was a project based curriculum to help better our portfolio, but none of the projects we've done I'd feel comfortable pinning on my GitHub or listing on my resume.\n\nSupport staff: The instructor... is a nice guy, but god awful at teaching. Incredibly basic concepts that even I could talk about would be explained in the most convoluted way possible that would leave everyone confused. Every single time a student asks a question, he fails to understand the meat of what they're asking and starts going off on some long tangent talking about stuff that isn't relevant to what they asked. He also is horrible at keeping pace with the class, and we will very often fall behind to the point where some assignments simply aren't covered or are explained during extra hours that he tacks on before class. Additionally, I feel sometimes like he just doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. I remember a specific time that the person sitting next to me asked him a pretty simple question (which should have been answered in the solutions to the assignment we were doing), and the instructor proceeded to go into a 10 minute tangent trying to figure out what to do, before I finally leaned over and answered her question in a sentence. I remember when we were discussing hypothesis testing that the instructor, in one day, attempted to: accept the null hypothesis, accept the alternative hypothesis, thought that a p-value of 0.5 was the usual threshold of significance (he said this multiple times, even after being corrected), and thought that we had a p-value of ~6.38 on one problem because he didn't understand what the e-05 at the end of the number meant (and seemed to still not get it after another student explained scientific notation to him).\n\n~~The TAs don't do anything. We had one good one who stopped participating after a couple months due to schedule overload, and after he left I don't think a TA has talked to me or asked me how I was doing on the assignments more than one or two times since. Other classmates have the same complaints. Instead, all they do is sit in the back and talk loudly to each other while the instructor is attempting to teach.~~ (see edit: I was being too harsh on them. They're doing their best, and honestly are the best part of the class) \n\nThere's a \"student success manager\" in charge of some behind the scenes of the class that also doesn't seem to do anything. We have weekly reviews that are submitted of how we're feeling about the class, and after I finally submitted 10 or so poor - mediocre reviews she emailed me asking what she can do to help, and after giving a response of my grievances I was met with silence. Career services so far has been useless. All we've done halfway through the class is develop a brand statement (elevator speech) and submitted our resume for review (my comments boiled down to put the bootcamp at the top of the resume and take out any academic achievements I had like my published paper, which... why...) or given information documents with stuff that seems blatantly wrong (We were given a document of skill clusters for different jobs, and I may be wrong here, but I don't think Hadoop is the 3rd most important skill a data scientist should have).\n\nCompanies Trilogy is *actually* partnered with: The previous session of the bootcamp that was hosted at the same location had their career day during one of our classes, so I got to see what they had to offer. And... it was maybe 10 or so tiny companies \/ startups I had seen on linkedin during my job hunt, and nothing from large companies that I'd like to have connections at. <massive company with ties to my city> was definitely *not* there. One of my classmates even talked to one of them and their recruiter told him that they weren't even looking for entry-level people, and were there for senior managers, which is just absolutely hilarious.\n\nOverall, the way I feel can be summed up as: I'm paying money for the company to use me as a partial TA. Half the time I'm in the class I'm helping answer questions of my classmates and explain things to them that I understood but went over their heads. I was told by the recruiter that I'd be a good fit and bring a lot to the class, but I didn't realize it would be in the form of free labor for them.\n\nThese grievances aren't just how I'm feeling either. I was thinking that I was the one person feeling this way about the class since I came in with an advanced background and thought \"maybe I was just at a level above what this is targeting,\" but after talking to some of my classmates who came in with no background in these topics (so what this bootcamp is targeting), they all feel the exact same way as me, except instead of feeling like they're wasting their time covering what they already know, they're wasting their time having everything explained to them poorly and then will need to go back and actually learn it on their own. Which, if that's the case for everyone, then why are we paying $10k a seat for an instructor and TAs to not be helpful?\n\nIf you're considering a bootcamp that's partnered with a university, and they seem to be partnered with a fair few, please check if the bootcamp is associated or hosted by Trilogy in any way. If it is, I would highly recommend against pursuing it. People in my situation (advanced degree, slight knowledge of what goes on in DS but no experience) would be far better off simply tackling some Kaggle problems and learning this on their own. People with absolutely no knowledge of what happens in DS won't develop proper skills here, unless the only thing you wanted to do was build web dashboards, which you could probably find some online resources covering exactly this for free. After spending a few months applying, I'm finally starting to get some responses for jobs, no thanks to this bootcamp. I'm not even sure if I should be listing it on my resume, to be quite frank, because I feel like the projects I've done on my own and my degree go a lot farther.\n\nHopefully someone in the same position I was in gets something from this post. Thanks for reading.\n\n__\n\nEdit: Looking back I was too harsh on the TAs. I'm probably fixating on a couple of off days that they had, and during class today I noticed they were going around and answering questions a lot more than I used to notice. We also have a newer one who definitely seems to be doing quite well.\n\nI stand by everything else I wrote though."],["Please don\u2019t average ordinal data - Started a blog to document my data science related PhD and I wrote about something that peeves the heck out of me.

The writing was originally meant to be a private reflection for myself to celebrate my two year twitterversary at Twitter, but I instead published it on Medium because I believe it could be very useful for many aspiring data scientists.\n\nFast forward to 2017, I have been working at Airbnb for a little bit less than two years and have recently become a senior data scientist \u2014 an industry title used to signal that someone has acquired enough technical skills to lead projects.

I've realized people management is a big drain on my time and I would rather focus my next few years in learning to be a better data scientist. My decision is also supported by the fact that I can switch back to people management at any time in the future. This move would only be lateral, with no pay-cuts or level changes.\n\nThrough this job hunting process, I've started noticing this trend of the title being used to cover every job from a Data\/BI Engineer, to a reporting analyst, to a business analyst, to an ML scientist. This is true not just at my current company, but across the tech industry in general.\n\nI was talking to a friend of mine at Amazon and it looks like they've figured this out with 5 titles:\n\n* **Applied Scientist** - you have to pass the bar for statistics, machine learning algorithms, and an entry level software development engineer\n\n* **Research Scientist** - you have to pass the bar for statistics and ML algorithms\n\n* **Data Scientist** - you have to pass the bar for statistics and basic ML\n\n* **Business Analyst** - you have to pass the bar for statistics and business case studies\n\n* **Data Engineer** - you are essentially a software engineer that builds data pipelines\n\nI really like how they have clearly defined competencies and job expectations.\n\nAnother annoyance I have with these job postings I'm reading is that the requirements don't match the job profile. There are roles that are reporting heavy, but require you to be an expert in deep-learning. \n\nFor external candidates, this creates a skewed perception of what the job profile will be, they end up joining the team and getting bored of what they are asked to do.\n\nI guess the point of my long rant is this:\n\n* **If you are a hiring manager, please write job descriptions that more or less accurately reflect the role** - I take this very seriously, but I don't see the same rigor among other hiring managers. I understand that you have to make the role attractive for smart candidates, but a bait and switch never works out long term. Smart candidates will smell your BS very quickly.\n\n* **If you are in HR - please consider redefining job titles** in a way that makes it easier to identify what the role would entail.\n\n**EDIT:** Looks like there are a lot of others who've faced similar problems. With over 10 years in the industry, I have found ways to overcome this problem of ambiguous titles. \n\nIf it's a possibility, always ask for an informational with the hiring manager before you interview. Even after you interview, ask for the possibility of an informational with a team member, hopefully a peer. You can use this time to ask pointed questions. Some that I always like to ask and have always appreciated candidates asking are:\n\n* What does a typical day look like for this position?\n* What are the tools your team uses on a daily basis?\n* What skills do you want this employee to have and why? \n* What does it take to be successful in the role? What are the typical career paths for someone in this position? \n* Who are your team's customers? What are their expectations? What are some of the recent successes of your team?"],["Does anyone else dislike the trend of take home 'case studies' for job interviews?","DataScience","I understand that it's a good way to develop a baseline to compare applicants apples to apples, but the idea of being given homework to spend hours on as they usually come with a 48-72 hour window with and an open ended prompt that doesn't have a stopping point. \n\nHonestly if I have a portfolio of work that you can see on Github that showcases technical skills and communication in the form of written summaries\/presentations I don't want to spend hours outside of work and other commitments on a one off analysis.

Would anyone find it helpful? Are people interested in Data science bootcamps? "],["How to get an internship in 2019","DataScience","So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.\n\nI have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.\n\nWhether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.\n\nIf you prefer video format, here\u2019s a video I made covering these topics:\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/eyzKYYwB0ng](https:\/\/youtu.be\/eyzKYYwB0ng)\n\nThe first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.\n\nThe second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \\[Insert college here\\], and then use people filters such as 1st \/2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.\n\nThe best people in your network to reach out to are:\n\n\\- College \/ coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at\n\n\\- Friends \/ classmates who interned at that company\n\n\\- Professors \/ mentors who might have connections with that company\n\n\\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - \u201cfriends of friends who worked at \\[X company\\]\n\nThe next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don\u2019t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples\u2019 work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you\u2019ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nHi \\[person\u2019s name\\]!\n\nMy name is \\[your name\\], and I\u2019m an \\[type of engineer\\] in \\[location\\].\n\nI\u2019m reaching out because I applied to \\[company\\] regarding your \\[position\\].\n\nI have experience with \\[this technology, skill, etc\\]\n\nFollowing up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.\n\nWould someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \\[insert date to add time pressure\\]?\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\\[Your name\\]\n\n\\[Phone number\\]\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nFollowing up after they\u2019ve responded:\n\nWould you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\\[Your name\\]\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThe most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don\u2019t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.\n\nIf you\u2019ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them \u201cHow can I stand out in the intern application process for \\[X\\] company?\u201d, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you\u2019d be a good fit.\n\nAnother way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn\u2019t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:\n\n\\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)\n\n\\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience\/projects section\n\n\\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)\n\n\\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them\n\nThe next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you\u2019ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won\u2019t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you\u2019ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you\u2019re ready to go because you know you prepared!\n\nThe final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There\u2019s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!\n\nI customized the funnel by tracking:\n\n1. Company Name\n2. Position Name\n3. Contact Name\n4. Contact Email\n5. Contact LinkedIn\n6. Date of Last Contact\n7. Job Source\n8. Job Posting URL\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet\/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!\n\nThe job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That\u2019s what will ultimately start you on your journey."],["job test: \"clean this data and develop a classification\"","DataScience","I'm in the running for a job and they've given me an analysis test.\n\nThey sent me an Excel spreadsheet with about 1100 rows of fake data, with the instructions \"clean this data and develop a classification\" and 4 classes.\n\nI can do the task however I see fit.\n\nMy question is:  How long should this take?\n\nI'm not really a data scientist.

That being said, there are far too many people who don't understand the math and end up using analysis techniques with little forethought into why they should be using that model. I will say this much: The more math, the better off you are. It is a beautiful field and directly relevant to you if you want to make the most of your foray into data science. \n\nBeginner: High school algebra, maybe some calculus 1, high school statistics\n\nIntermediate: College stats, Calc 1,2,3, Probability Theory, linear algebra, Statistical Inference\n\nAdvanced: Upper undergrad \/ Grad level statistical inference, bayesian inference, harder probability theory, linear optimization, convex optimization, real analysis, calculus of variations. Math is the limiting factor, remove those obstacles. Learn all the advanced math you can muster.\n\nReccs: khanacademy if you've never seen the content. MIT OCW has really great self paced math courses for calc 1-3, linear algebra and much more. Eventually you will want to learn the art of grinding through math textbooks while doing problems. **The only way to learn math is by doing math. Practice, practice, practice.**\n\nIf you want to be a true OG, here is Michael I. Jordan's reading list for prospective grad students in ML: \n\n[Mike I. Jordan ML Books](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=1055389)\n\n**Programming**\n\nPick up a language and stick with it for now. It is far easier to pick up a second language once you are very good at one than it is to slowly work through being mediocre at a bunch of languages. \n\nPeople live and die by their language of choice for some reason. Generally, my thoughts on this are the following:\n\nR is fantastic. R is great for data analysis, and if you use the tidyverse, R is great for everything else too. R is an **organically grown** language that is not always lexically consistent, so it can be a bit quirky. Due to the community of statistics researchers that use R, generally you will find the most bleeding edge packages on R. R will make you think like a statistician.\n\nPython is great for taking your data a bit farther. It has packages which provide most of the functionality you would need from R. Python is a great choice because it has many more varied packages and capabilities related to software development. Python is a broad, general purpose language that is beautifully **designed** and consistent. This will make you think more like a programmer.\n\nOver a career, it is wise to know as many tools well as you can. Since you will spend a good amount of time writing code, you should strive to learn both at some point. \n\nAlrighty, now onto the core stuff. \n\n**How to:**\n\n**1. Get Data**\n\nThis can be done by scraping, downloading a data set, building a data set, making a survey, whatever. There is a lot of data floating around and there are plenty of resources for learning how to scrape. Since data is usually stored in data bases in the real world, it is wise to learn a bit about data bases. Learn some SQL. Since we live in the age of big data, it would also be wise to learn non-relational database query languages like nosql and postgresql\n\nSome good spots for data: \/r\/datasets, kaggle, data.gov\n\n**2. Clean it**\n\nRemember: garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the data is the foundation of all your work from here on out. Check out a book or a course that will take you from these early stages into actually playing with the data. For python, [Harvard CS109](https:\/\/github.com\/cs109\/content) does this. It also have video lectures. For R, Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at RStudio) has a bunch of amazing books out. Check out [R for Data Science](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model\/dp\/1491910399\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1511408512&sr=8-1&keywords=r+for+data+science) . It wouldn't hurt to eventually read a book on data cleaning and data interpolation.\n\n**3. Take some time to familiarize yourself with your data**\n\nWhat kind of variables are there? Quantitative (numbers)? Categorical \/ Qualitative (Labels)? Text? Images?\n Geographical? The types of data present will determine what can be modeled. \n\nIts a good idea to look at the data in list form and plot it out using R or python or excel or whatever. If using other types of data (eg images, geographical), then find the best ways to visualize the data. Now would be a good time to learn about knitr and rmarkdown if using R and jupyter notebooks if using python. \n\nThis is the time to do some *descriptive statistics.* Look at the way the data flows on the plots. What relationships do you think are there? Are there any outliers? Plot, plot, plot, and plot some more. Make the plots look good. Check out ggplot2 in R or matplotlib \/ seaborn in python. \n\nLearn to dissect your data. Check out feature engineering. Learn to combine data sets to expand what can be done.\n\nIf you want to be a true OG, learn some graphic design principles. Learn to use blank space and color. There is nothing more influential than a beautiful graph. \n\nReccs: \n\nLanguage Agnostic: [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information\/dp\/0961392142\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1511409465&sr=1-1&keywords=tufte+visual+display)\n\n[GGplot2 book](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis\/dp\/331924275X\/ref=pd_sim_14_7?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=V86PEMXGW96XK2JF2AHX)\n\nA book on seaborn \/ matplotlib if using python. \n\n**4. Figure out the questions you want to ask**\n\nThis is perhaps the hardest part. The questions you ask will determine what you find in the data. When thinking about questions, ponder proactively about what techniques you would use to answer them. This is where a broad set of modeling tools comes handy. That will be gone over in the next section.\n\n**5. Analysis**\n\nThe most satisfying part in my opinion. When you wrote out your questions, hopefully you have some idea of what techniques you would use. That said, there are a lot of techniques to choose from and each technique has its own special niches. You will learn to select models properly from seeing a lot of data and practicing. Like everything else, practice, practice, practice. Try many models, run them on test sets using cross validation and see what works best. Learn about bias-variance trade-off. \n\nGenerally statistical analysis is broken into 2 parts: \n\nIn descriptive statistics we want to describe the patterns and structure of the data. If you did part 3 well, this will be partially taken care of. You can expand on this as the analysis comes along. \n\nIn inferential statistics we want to predict from the data. This is what we are at now. \n\nBroadly speaking, this is the content that seems to be spread around the most. I will post some reccs to different courses \/ books that you will see floating around this subreddit (because they are great).\n\n**Make sure you learn and understand cross validation extremely well.**\n\n**Make sure to understand the assumptions behind each modeling technique you use. There is no one size fits all technique.** \n\nSince this is such a broad topic, go learn data analysis from books and courses.

Ideally you would do both. \n* Learn database query languages. You will come across databases, so its best to be a wizard with them. \n* Learn hadoop \/ map reduce \/ spark for big data\n* Learn the theory on a deeper level.

I think I'm a pretty smart, discerning person, but the things I've read and heard about this career are, as a whole, so confusing and so contradictory it's hard to know what to think.\n\nSeveral months ago, after doing some research, I thought this was a viable path for me and that I had a plan to get into the field. Today, I don't know whether any of the things I believed about this career months ago are true, whether it's realistic for me to get a data science position in the near future, or whether this is a career I would even want.\n\nI thought I'd list paraphrased version of some of the confusing and often contradictory things I've read and heard about this career for your amusement. If anyone has thoughts, by all means please comment, although at this point I don't think I'll believe anything anyone says about this stuff without experiencing it firsthand.\n\n* Data science is a viable career path for people without a strong technical background who are willing to take a couple online courses.\n\n* It's very straightforward to get a data scientist position if you have an advanced degree in any quantitative field, especially if you can code.\n\n* It's almost impossible to get a data scientist position right out of (grad) school. No matter what field your degree was in, you probably need to spend a couple years working as a data analyst or BI person to get some domain expertise.\n\n* Data science is a field with a serious talent shortage; companies are desperate for anyone who's at all qualified.\n\n* The data science job market is flooded with applicants; any open job is going to get dozens if not hundreds of reasonably qualified applicants. It's really hard to get a job unless you seriously stand out. \n\n* The technical skills are the least important aspect. It's more important to work well with people and be a good communicator. You can easily learn the technical aspects on the job.\n\n* A data scientist just needs to know more statistics than a programmer and more coding than a statistician.\n\n* A data scientist needs to know all about optimization, numerical analysis, algorithms and data structures, and lots of advanced machine learning and statistics.\n\n* The only things you really have to know are the fundamentals: be able to write some code in Python and R and know about confidence intervals and linear regression.\n\n* In order to appeal to employers, it's crucial to have experience with the *exact technologies* the employer uses. If they use Hadoop, you must know Hadoop. Etc.\n\n* There's no way to be a data scientist without knowing some pretty advanced math.\n\n* Math isn't really relevant for data science in practice, and some of the most successful data scientists I know don't even know calculus.\n\n* Data scientists spend their time working on intellectually challenging problems that are just as interesting as those in academia.\n\n* Data scientists spend most of their time on boring data munging issues, usually with an ultimate goal of selling more shoes or some other horrible marketing thing.\n\n* The data science field is really hot and will surely continue to grow for many years to come.\n\n* Data science has hit its peak; it will continue to be useful in its areas of legitimate application, but companies are realizing it was oversold and they will be cutting back.\n\n* There is an amazing amount of value to be had in data science.\n\n* Most data scientists contribute nothing worthwhile to their employers.\n\n* You must have a portfolio of projects to show employers.\n\n* I don't know any data scientists with a portfolio of projects; my coworkers and I think that's a waste of time.\n\nHere's another discouraging thing: looking at job ads for data scientist positions, there is such a crazy variety of skills and experience desired for each position. While I know that \"Required skills\" aren't always really required, it's pretty bewildering when:\n\n* one position says you must have NLP experience;\n\n* one says you must have cybersecurity experience;\n\n* one says you must have Javascript and web programming experience (?!);\n\n* one says you must have experience in the health care industry;\n\n* one says you must have retail marketing experience;\n\n* one says you must have bioinformatics experience;\n\n* one says you must have experience in the intelligence community;\n\n* one says you must have Django experience (?!);\n\n* one says you must have experience with the Microsoft products SSMS, SSAS, and SSRS;\n\n* one says you must know SAS;\n\n* one says you must have experience in financial analysis.\n\nIn the above list, when I listed specific technologies, it was because they seem somewhat outside the standard data science toolkit, as far as I know. But even when they mention \"mainstream\" technologies, they vary so much between the different positions, and there is such a massive list. Different ones want AWS, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, PostgreSQL, MySQL, D3, Tableau, MapReduce, Flink, Mahout, MongoDB, Cassandra, and many more.\n\nJudging by the ads, there is probably hardly anyone in the world who is qualified for more than one of these positions... and yet they are all \"data scientist\" positions.\n\nActually, I think half these employers just copy & pasted a bunch of buzzwords into their ads, but that's depressing for another reason."],["Seven Practical Ideas For Beginner Data Scientists - Written by my friend and old colleague DS.","DataScience",""],["Data Search Engines?

Nobody cares that you have a cool ML algorithm if it does not save or make the company any money. \n\n* Always have a simple baseline model to compare more complex models to.

My original plan was to stay 3 more years from today, and continue saving as much as possible to move back with some savings, with the prospect of retiring early.\n\nHowever I am realizing that not only salaries will be significantly lower in France (we're talking 3x lower), but the prospects do not look so exciting from a DS perspective (e.g. archaic corporations who look for data analysts, or startups who use words like \"neural networks\" in every sentence).\n\nAnyone has been in a similar situation and would be able to provide some guidance?"],["Guidelines for writing data analysis reports","DataScience","I have just started my career as a data scientist in the telecommunication industry and works with a lot of customer data.

Sorry if it's not this one.\n\nSo I'm a data analyst, not a data scientist. I just finished grad school (not data science) and I'm between jobs and about to move to a new city, so I've been taking the last few weeks to go through Datacamp's material fairly intensely (~4 hours a day) to upgrade my skills before I get my hopes and dreams crushed by the job market.\n\n...\n\n\nThe **first** thing I noticed about Datacamp was that they did a lot of stuff *for* me. I'd open up an exercise and most of the code had been written already, with a couple of spaces with '____' where I should fill in the right answer. I thought this was really frustrating, because there was never any point in the process where they explained to me why we needed to perform whatever operation it was. I'm like 50 hours in, and I'm not sure I could do any of this without Datacamp's prompting. I think this is the worst part of the Datacamp curriculum. I feel that I'm paying Datacamp to teach me Python syntax and when to use it (not just how to use it), and I feel like I'm not learning either of those things.\n\n**Second,** although Datacamp courses offer short video segments that putatively \"teach\" the course, the exercises were essentially big text boxes. Oftentimes the video and text would be somewhat out of sync, and sometimes it felt like entire sections had been omitted between text and video. This made watching the videos almost completely optional, and considering most of them are shorter than 5 min, there was never enough time to substantively introduce the material anyway.\n\n**Third**, the exercises rarely feel practical. There are some nice real-world datasets used, but because of what I describe in my first paragraph, it's hard to actually interface with them. You're not really working with them yourself. Beyond that, it doesn't feel like Datacamp spends a lot of time trying to motivate the problem. Why do we need to take this approach, etc. There are often domain-specific considerations that influence how the problem may best be solved, and that stuff is completely omitted. This ends up meaning that these supposedly practical exercises end up anything but.\n\nI had a really long paragraph here about how **I dislike their two-part statistics course**. TL;DR: I thought the treatment of linear regression was really shallow and incomplete (there's no mention of residuals at all, for example), and I thought leaving out multiple and logistic regression meant it didn't provide enough for students to actually learn how to work with data. I've never worked as a data scientist, but I understand that those two are important. They're already super useful as an analyst.\n\n**That's not to say that Datacamp is terrible.** I really liked some of the data viz stuff they've got (Seaborn and Bokeh are awesome), and I think their first couple of intro to Python courses are helpful. I've heard great things about their R courses, as well. And Datacamp has got a great platform for what they're doing.\n\nI'm certainly going to finish my month of Datacamp, but I don't think I'll be resubscribing. I know it's kind of a cheap shot, but I feel like I might subscribe to one of their competitor products in the hope that they can teach me more of the syntax and thought process behind this stuff. I'm disappointed to be paying somebody to teach me, only to have to Google what they're supposed to be teaching."],["What does a good Github\/portfolio for Data Science look like?","DataScience","I'm trying to beef up my Github\/portfolio, but I'm not sure exactly what I should be shooting for.

By that, I specifically mean visually based tools which do not involve real code.\n\nA bit about me: I work in a company that uses Alteryx and Tableau to do the majority of their data analysis. In the past few months, I've realised that there is so much more scope out there for data analysis and data analytics beyond Alteryx and Tableau; namely, things like machine learning, statistical modelling using R, and using languages like Python to do... stuff (not sure exactly what it can do but I've only heard good things).\n\nRecently, when I tried to transition into a more \"technical\" data analytics role that uses Python, R, and SQL, I've been shooed away because of an apparent skill gap. I've got this impression that people think that because I don't actually code at the moment for work, because I use 'drag-and-drop' tools like Tableau\/Alteryx, that I don't have the skills to do the \"real\" stuff.\n\nIt frustrates me because I learned coding at university and took to it like a fish to water. Moreover, it's not as if I've been sitting around doing nothing - I work with data everyday, it's just usually in csv\/Excel\/txt format so I use Alteryx instead of SQL, and I don't visualise using ggplot2, but I chuck it into Tableau.\n\nIt's just unfortunate I suppose that the line of work I got into after uni is about business-facing analytics and with a heavy emphasis on explanation to stakeholders. After all, what's easier to explain to a non-technical person, a pretty Alteryx workflow that neatly splits out and joins the data, or 100 lines of SQL with SELECT this and INNER JOIN that?\n\nI suppose what I want to get out of posting this is - what the role is of these drag-and-drop tools in organisations that do data analytics, whether learning and honing skill in these is even useful, and how those of us who are using these can transition into the seemingly greener pasture of actual data analytics coding\/programming (and is it actually greener?).\n\nThanks all!"],["I got an interview question about when not to use cross validation, and couldn't think of a time not to.

I hire data scientists so I thought I would tell you what I look for when I\u2019m hiring newbies.  Experienced people are another story. \n\nFirst, you need to be able to code.  And I\u2019m more interested in hacking skills more than formal systems development. If you need a formal requirements document and 6 agile sprints to complete a data science engagement you are taking too long.  Besides, 50%-70% of your work will be taking the crappy data you are given and putting it in a form that can be analyzed. For that you\u2019ll need PERL, Python, VB, etc.  After you have done it you probably don\u2019t need to do it again in the exact same way.  So you need to hack that mother.  It would be awesome if you had minions to do the shit work for you but let\u2019s face it, if you are just coming out of school you are the minion.  I knew people in grad school that got straight A\u2019s but couldn\u2019t program their way out of a paper bag.  I don\u2019t want those people.  So convince me that you can write code. \n\nYou need to understand data.  This seems to be under represented in \u201chow to be a data scientist\u201d posts but it is very important.  But  you need to have a good feel for data representation and modeling.  Sooner or later you will need to impose structure on data or the data that is given to you will be highly structured.  Being able to put your data in the correct form can make all the difference in the world when it comes to accuracy and speed of analysis.  \n\nYou need to be curious.  If you see a dead squirrel on the top floor of a parking garage and your first thought is \u201cEwwwww, a dead squirrel\u201d I don\u2019t want you.  If you first thought is \u201cHmmm, why did that squirrel come up here if there are no trees nearby? There isn\u2019t any squirrel food around to draw him in.   How did he die? I assume that he was hit by a car but is that really the case?\u201d  and  you go into full CSI:Rodent mode then you are someone I want to talk to.  If something slightly odd pops up during your analysis it could be your mistake, bad data or an interesting discovery.  All of these are important but if you don\u2019t notice and follow up on the initial oddity then we\u2019ll never know will we?  I understand if you keep that side of you under wraps around normal people.  I do as well. My friends and close relatives all think I\u2019m strange when I start wondering out loud about things like that.  If you haven\u2019t read all the Sherlock Holmes stories then maybe you should.  However, that being said don\u2019t take it too far.  I\u2019ve seen stats people go down rabbit holes for weeks and come back with a set of technically correct but complete useless results.  This is especially true with big data systems.  There are an infinite number of cool but useless things you can find. Your curiosity should always be filtered though the sieve of practicality.  Just keep asking yourself if what you are investigating will ultimately be useful to the client. \n\nYou need imagination.  There are multiple ways to approach any analytic problem and you need to be able to see most of those.  More importantly you need to be able to imagine entirely brand new problems that can be solved with the data and tools that you have.  If you only find what you are told to find you are a failure.  Convince me that you can see things that others can\u2019t.  Unless what you see are hallucinations then please keep those to yourself.  \n\n\n\nTell me a story.   You need to be able to convert your brilliant analysis into something that normal people can understand.  If you use the term \u201cp-value\u201d while explaining results to a client I\u2019ll dock your pay.  Unless you are lucky enough to have a client that understands all that stuff. Then by all means, geek out.  You need to have good communications skills.  You need to explain your results, why they are significant and why someone should trust them in a way that civilians understand.  You will also need to interact with clients on a continual basis since you may understand analytic techniques but you most likely won\u2019t understand the domain you are working in.  A big part of data science is learning about the business domain you are operating in. If you don\u2019t, you run the risk of embarrassing yourself by giving clients results that are obviously wrong or trivial.  My first results that I delivered to a client many years ago were horribly wrong because of some fundamentally incorrect assumptions I made about the completeness of the data that I would have known about had I asked. And they were completely obtuse.  My work product sucked and I paid the price.  \n\nFinally, you need an area of technical analytic expertise.  This is where your background in stats, machine learning,  natural language processing, etc. comes in.  There isn\u2019t much to really say here.  If you are coming out of school  this is what your degree should be in or you need to have shown a significant project or two in these areas.  You should be able to describe how to solve a sample problem that I throw at you using your preferred technology. I expect you to be technically competent in one area and conversant in the rest. \n\nHmmm, this was way longer than I thought it would be.  Hopefully it helps.  Of course additions, comments and vicious flames welcome. \n"],["Couldn't afford GPUs as a student.

But I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in math. My math minor which included probability models, applied statistics in R, mathematical statistics (proofs of t-test and other things you never want to prove like the Rao-Blackwell theorem), and bayesian statistics with R. I chose work over grad-school because I was unsure exactly what field I wanted to go into and did not want to spend money on a degree that would not further my career. I think the biggest thing that set me apart when I was interviewing was my demonstration that I can learn on my own. Personal projects were something that interviewers were very curious about and I was happy to show them a web-scrapper I built or a website with MySQL developed in django. \n\nA little bit about my job: I work as a marketing analyst for a natural gas company trying to bring insight into different strategies and predict a variety of different things.

Our company actual uses PowerBI for visualization and reports and it is horribly slow, but very free. Coming out of undergrad I was excited to dive right into applied machine learning algorithms and tried to learn as much as I can about that. But, I think the most important thing is curiosity and wanting to learn about the actual business itself. It is impossible to be a good data analyst if you don't know why the data is being presented to you the way it is. In order to answer interesting questions, you first need to be able to ask them and that all starts with playing with the data and visualizations (EDA!!), not just throwing a random forest regression, SVM, or naive bayes algorithm from scikit-learn. \n\nOverall it has been a great experience.

Both my BSc, MSc, and PhD were in STEM fields. I decided to make the switch to data science after seeing some friends have success in the area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had no formal experience in data science\/AI, although I had much coding experience (mainly python and matlab) from my degrees. So I decided to self teach data science and then apply for jobs. There were many ups and downs in the process as a whole, and a lot of lessons I learned as I went along in the job hunt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo form a solid understanding of the machine learning field, I started by going through a machine learning primer on [pythonprogramming.net](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net). I found a nice mix of math theory (low level) and code. The course covered all of the main algorithms used in machine learning by first explaining the behind the scenes idea and then coding a algorithm from scratch and then (in some cases) using it on a dataset. Towardsdatascience also is great (for the right author) for getting a quick easy overview of something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this I applied to my first round of jobs, and found that this is probly not enough to get in the field. I got a few interviews, but response rate was about 7% of my applications (applied for about 50 jobs). I applied for all jobs online, via indeed, glassdoor, etc. While applying I started an excel file listing all applications and dates applied. This gave me a way to measure response rates and see what helped increase this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, after realizing I needed something more, I took on a new undertaking. I reworked through in depth math of the popular algorithms using Elements of Statistical Learning (textbook freely available online). Then, I found some data sets online (either off kaggle or the UCI repository) and went through an entire in depth project on these sets. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive. I mean really clean out the problem, I read publications about the dataset, established baselines, interpreted results, etc. I then made a github account and made a data science portfolio and posted a couple of projects on there. Then I reopened the application process and applied to about 50 more jobs. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ANY ADVICE TAKE THIS: make a porfolio and post a project. Choose a project that is socially relevant and any layman could see why its interesting (ie healthcare, not Gaussian data distributions). This astronomically increased my responses. I would estimate that, per 20 applications, I got interviews for 5-6 jobs. After much interviewing I finally got a good offer which I accepted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInterviews follow the same basic structure everywhere, and here's what I learned going through them:\n\n1. The HR screen. After bungling a couple of these I finally figured them out; after an HR screen now I would say I have a near 100% conversion rate to a second round interview. They don't know technical stuff, they want to get an idea of who you are and make sure you aren't a weirdo and can articulate yourself. So here's how to ace them: find a project you worked on and explain the technical concepts to them in VERY easy to understand ways. I found explaining algorithms using sports analogies very effective. Relate the project to someone who doesn't care about data science; why is the problem interesting, what are implications of your results. Besides that be prepared to answer the basics like \"why are you interested in this company\", \"how do you face challenges\", etc.\n2. 2) the technical interview. The contents of this stage really varies. Most times, I would be asked to explain technical aspects of my DS projects. They would start off with \"explain a project youve worked on and how you solved it\". Why did I use this algorithm and not another, why did I do a dimensional reduction, how did I clean the data, etc. Then, I would get asked to explain the workings of a particular algo I had used. Some would ask that I explain it to someone who didn't know about computers, and some would ask I explain the math and algorithm structure. If you paid attention to my first point you'll be ready for the layman explanation. So be prepared for both. I would really prepare a nice \"lecture\" about an algo, because some would just say \"explain your favorite algorithm\".  Some will go through your resume and ask you to explain buzzwords, so be prepared for that.\n3. 3) the coding challenge. These are annoying. They are generally easy, most I got were binary classification problems. A couple I got were just data sets and they said \"do something interesting\". If you've done a DS project it shouldn't be hard. The annoying part is that most would say \"this should take about 4 hours, heres 5 days to turn it in\". So what I imagine happens, is some candidates spend 4 hours and get some interesting insights and send it off, and others spend 5 days straight doing a crazy analysis of it. One company arranged a time I would like the challenge to be sent to me, and I had to submit results within 4 hours. I think this is the best format, as it really puts everyone on the same playing field. I would suggest doing a very simple practice classification problem from a common dataset (the UCI wine thing for example) and just get a \"template\" ready that isn't too difficult to change between basic datasets. Also, some jobs that blasted me a dataset without a phone call or email first I found quite rude and didn't pursue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal tips: I know many people on this sub complain about buzzword resumes; but Ill offer a different take. The people who get a giant pile of resumes to sort through are the HR people; I had a friend who is an HR rep for a DS company look over my resume. These HR people don't know DS; they have a job description for a role that has buzzwords in it (candidate should know regression, tensorflow, blah blah) and they match your resume to that. So I found that by including buzzwords  (listed algorithms I knew, math I knew)  I increased my response rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I added a section in my resume explaining the DS projects I had done and tools I used to do them (bold font the tools for fast reading), this also increases response rate (link to your github portfolio too). All in all, the job hunt process is a meat grinder and sucks. I sent out a total of about 100 job applications, got a couple cheapo offers that I declined, and accepted a solid one. I completed about 30 interviews. The whole process took about 3 months. The jobs I didn't get interviews for I think is because I didn't match the description exactly or didn't match the experience requirement, lots of them want big data framework experience which I didn't have (hadoop, apache etc). This would be easy to learn, but the screeners don't know this really so probly tossed my resume. I would've learned it myself but getting 4 coding challenges a week bogs you down a bit :P.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, the increase in interview requests and inceased knowledge is not just a correlation, it's a causation.

It classifies if a particular document is a contract or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy team created a pipeline that fetches documents, OCR them, classify them and make them available in a web application, so that our users can find them way faster than by using the other methods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe classifier was trained with 1K documents and deployed with > 90% F-score to production (I did the training, testing and validation stuff to prevent overfitting). We then needed to tell the stakeholders our classification accuracy, because of that, I sampled 1K from the 33K classified documents and we manually annotated the sample so that we could calculate the number of contracts labeled as not contracts (false negatives) and the number of documents that were not contracts but were classified as contracts (false positives).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI then looked at the false positives and false negatives for patterns, after finding patterns in the errors, I created regular expressions that reduced the error for some patterns, and re-trained the models for the other patterns that came from new documents that were entirely different from the samples we had in the initial dataset. After updating the model, the F-score went up to > 90% again, and we got better results when looking in the web application, so the problem of performance was solved. BUT, I think my approach to this problem was very intuitive and not very science-y, so I figured out another way of doing this, a more statistical way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm thinking about doing in the next time, is to make a [sample size calculation](https:\/\/www.surveysystem.com\/sscalc.htm) using the total of documents in production as the population, confidence level of 95% percent and confidence interval of 3%. Then do a random sample of N documents, annotate them and calculate the F-score.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, my fellow data scientists, I would like to know how you do this kind of performance monitoring for classifiers. Also, do you think that my idea has any flaw ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing, my new idea will use a confidence interval of 3%, does that imply that the score that I calculate after annotating documents from my random sampling will have a range of +- 3% ? For example if I calculate a F-score of 94%, does it mean that my F-score, actually is 91-97%, because I did a sample of the population ? Or am I oversimplifying things and this is not how confidence intervals actually work ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for the input, I really appreciate it.

Anyway, my use case and data is as follows:\n\n1. A set of meter consumption data.  Roughly 400 meters, with hourly readings going back roughly a year, so roughly 3.5M records.\n2. A listing of \\~ 50 meters that failed efficiency tests; i.e., run 1000 gallons of water through the meter, and the meter registered 980 gallons, or 1020 gallons)  \\[or more\/less\\].  Metadata on date of test and the efficiency rating measurements is included.  I have given him three reading values for meters that failed in the past, high efficiency, low efficiency, and an average of the two.\n3. Measurements at field testing time include a high flow efficiency ratios (i.e., a shit ton of water going through the meter) and low flow efficiency ratios (normal amount of water).  Unfortunately, in the consumption data, we only have a total consumption value; i.e., consumption is not broken down into high\/low registers, even though this is how testing is performed.\n\nI tell this guy, look at the consumption records across the entire dataset, use the failing meters as training data set, write a model that can tell me which \\*other\\* meters are probable failures.   (The existing process for determination of failures is annual, manual inspection of each large commercial meter.  Very labor intensive and subject to extended periods of a meter reporting inappropriately.)\n\nOK.  Anyway, the guy doesn't know the tools that I'd like him to have experience in, so I give him some time to come up on them.  But then, a few weeks in, I say, show me what you have and the shit just doesn't look like he's got half a clue.  So I say, convince me you've got a plan to attack this problem because I am not seeing it.  He sends this response:\n\n>The model with only one independent variable (i.e. AVG efficiency) is prone to underfit and will be biased \u2013 we may miss the relevant relations between features and our output variable. So first I will have to figure the ways to balance the bias-variance tradeoff in our use case.\n\n(?) OK, but I also gave him high and low efficiency reading values.\n\n>Second, the consumption data is a tricky part here. There can be various scenarios that may cause the consumption data the way it is right now. For example, the resident can be out for vacation. Meter is installed in a store room etc. Additionally, Daily aggregation isn\u2019t a good idea here because it doesn\u2019t tell anything about the meter\u2019s health, so I am trying out week level aggregation, month level and also quarterly level aggregation. I know that quarterly level aggregation would be too much but there is no harm in testing our hypothesis.\n\nI asked him to explain to a dumb ass like me why we would want to use daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation when we have hourly data available?  \\[got no response\\]  It seemed to me that we lose a lot of granularity of our data here, making it more problematic to identify changes.  (?)  Note:  These are commercial meters and I don't care about vacations and \/ or store rooms \/ they are all stored outside.  I have identified those meters that are irrigation (not too many of them).  I have rainfall data, but he hasn't asked for it.\n\n>Our solution is going to use a classifier to distinguish between cases of legitimate, such as residents on vacation, and illegitimate, as malfunctioning or tampered, zero-consumption meters.\n\nThese meters aren't being tampered with, the people running them are businesses, and I have existing processes to determine zero consumption situations.  The whole point is to determine malfunctioning meters and if anyone out there is clever enough to tamper with a goddamn ultra-sonic water meter, I'm inclined to let them have water on general principle.\n\nUltimately, I can't figure out if this guy has a clue or is just saying stuff to keep on submitting timesheets?  It would be one thing if he could tell me to have a field tech go test meters A\/B\/C\/D\/E and we could see how the efficiency ratings came back, but it feels like he's a ways off from being able to do that.

Yes, I have had weekly meetings with the contractor and asked, 'do you have any questions?  what else might help you?' and at no point did they mention wanting some of the other data sets mentioned.  At no point has he commented that there may not be sufficient data points to perform an appropriate analysis, which may speak to competence of the willingness to suck the contract dry.  That being said, I \\*have\\* told him that I have other projects behind this and more contracts could be waiting if we showed success.  Intentionally sandbagging would seem to be a dumb idea given that information.  (?) \n\nNinja edit 3:  Failure rates occur at nearly identical 19% rates across the two manufacturer\/models that comprise 87% of the commercial meters in question.  I cannot see how this metadata would help a model, but I will supply it to the guy.  Another manufacturer failed 33% of the time, but has only 5% of the meters in the entire system.

I started the program today and it is a two-year program.\n\nThis past summer I was hired as a Data Analyst Intern at a startup. Although I was not officially Data Scientist Intern, I did do some machine learning while on the job and implemented algorithms at various points. I don't think there is much difference between a Data Analyst Internship and a Data Scientist Internship **within a tech startup**. I do not know how data analyst interns operate in accounting firms, banks, etc.\n\n**The Interview**\n\nAfter a phone screening, I was invited to interview at the office. The first part was a behavioral interview with the Data Team Lead. The second part was a technical interview with the Data Scientist. \n\nQ1: Explain one of your projects on your resume to me as if I am a client.\n\nA: The best way to answer this question is to be as vague as possible. Clients\/non-engineering members don't care about the algorithm you used or the results of the confusion matrix. What they do care about is how these results will affect their profits or their company in general. Don't talk about the decision tree implementation, talk about how the significant factors you found that led to the classification of the predicted value.\n\nQ2: Design a retail\/book\/grocery store relational database\n\nA2: Basically you want a table of all the transactions, the items and their prices, customers, each with keys that can join to the other table. I was also asked to limit the tables, join the tables, order a table and group by a table. We ran out of time, but the next part was CTEs.\n\n**The Internship**\n\nAs an intern I was asked to do a variety of things. However, my most used skill while at my internship was web-scraping. I developed scripts to scrape websites for a variety of information needed to make the company's current information more useful. If you do not know how to web scrape, I highly suggest you learn it. I personally use BeautifulSoup.\n\nThe data team was very small so I had the opportunity to work on all types of projects, including working with PDF and free text data. Therefore, I also learned how to work with unstructured data. This is a pretty daunting task and if you ever end up having to work with this form of data, I highly recommend keeping your bosses in the loop. I didn't and finished it with only a day to spare which was not ideal. \n\nI also worked with the data scientist to productionalize and augment the current models. While the data scientist worked on more pressing matters, I was testing different algorithms and examining outputs in forms such as confusion matrices, lift charts, AUC curves, etc. \n\n**Conclusion**\nOverall, I found this experience enjoyable. Although working at big 4 companies is ideal, I think working at start ups in big cities like New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, etc. is also super valuable. Being on a small team gave me some more responsibility than an intern would get and although none of the work I did was critical, it still provided value and left me in good terms with the employer.\n\nIf there was anything anyone else wanted to know that won't remove the anonymity of the company.

Basically, I don't view these as mutually exclusive, but I recently was rejected from a job interview because I was \"more focused on predictions instead of inference\" and was hoping to receive some feedback.\n\nTo provide more context: as part of the hiring process, I was tasked with finding if there was any relationship between dairy intake and eventual cancer diagnosis using published survey data (while controlling for common confounders such as age, gender, etc.).\n\nThe approach that I took, among others, was to create a logistic regression model with cancer as the binary response, and predictors such as dairy intake, age, gender, etc. First, I tuned the regularization parameter and class weighting (the cancer diagnosis was obviously unbalanced) with cross-validation and showed F1, recall, and precision metrics for the out-of-sample data. After optimizing the model based on the CV metrics, I looked at normalized coefficient weights to determine relative effect size of the various parameters. I performed additional analyses such as exploring minority class upsampling, collinearity of predictors, and looking at standard errors \/ p-values.\n\nI felt pretty good about my approach, but received this comment from the hiring manager: \n\n\"I looked through your project. I am very impressed with your thoroughness - for example, not a lot of candidates checked the collinearity and did the upsampling. But as I said on the phone, you are heavily towards the prediction side of data science, as opposed to the inference\/statistics side. One example is that when you performed the logistic regression, the first thing you show is the precision metric etc, instead of the significance of different variables - the coefficients alone do not mean anything without the standard error. I know you have shown the significance table later but clearly you put that in a less important position even when the project is about finding whether there is a relationship between diary and cancer, not about predicting cancer. That said, there is nothing wrong with being focused on prediction - it is just not what this position needs. You will be perfectly fine with other positions that need prediction more than inference.\" \n\nSo I guess I'm a bit confused about the difference between creating models for prediction vs. inference. In my view, you want your model to fit the data as accurately as possible, and the best way validate a model is looking at out-of-sample error. Simply fitting an OLS model, printing an R^2 value, and looking at p-values can lead to an over-fit model and invalid inference conclusions. Once you have a valid model, I understand that standard error and p-values can be useful, but for multivariate regression with large n, you are getting a pooled standard error and many of your predictors will show significance. Thus in a lot of cases, it's more useful to focus more on effect size and perform analyses related to how each factor affects, e.g. adjusted R^2.\n\nAny thoughts that can be offered as to whether I'm on the right track or should adjust my thinking would be much appreciated!\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who has responded.

(My experience)","DataScience","Hi,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince completing my Masters in Data Science, I have had a number of people contact me asking for my experience with the course and whether it is worth recommending. Therefore, I thought it best to summarise my decision for starting the course, what I have achieved during my studies, and the outcome in the years following. I created this article for Medium but thought it would be good to post it here as well to help discussions as I often see questions about Data Science Masters and whether they are worth it. \n\n### Why did I choose to study Data\u00a0Science?\n\nIt was the spring of 2016 and I was coming towards the end of a 6 month internship at one of the largest consulting firms in the City of London. I had taken this role to gain experience and figure out whether becoming an Actuary was the correct route for my career. I quickly found passion in the data analytics of the role as I was being pulled into meetings to discuss numbers I had crunched or was able hack together a tool to automate previously manual tasks. However, I also found that the traditional track I would be heading on if I moved onto the graduate scheme no longer interested me due to years of standardised exams and little to no creativity. Furthermore, most of my work at this point was within Excel and I was gaining little to no coding experience.\n\nIt was at this point I also started to explore a magical term that kept coming up in my job searches: *Data Science*. I had come from a background in mathematics and, due to the nature of the job market in the UK, had been nudged towards the well-founded traditional roles such as accountancy and actuarial consulting. And yet, here was a new role that defied all the expectations I had set for myself of my future career. Where becoming an Actuary I would be solving problems by learning regulatory standards, Data Scientists are encouraged to creatively find solutions that fit within the commercial environment. Furthermore, the role opportunities were no longer fixed into a few select firms but almost all companies were looking for some variation of a Data Scientist and the idea that I could move into a completely new industry, from fashion to finance, greatly appealed to my interests.\n\nHowever, as I started to apply for Data Science roles it quickly became apparent that **I was lacking two key skills: applying Machine Learning and coding.**\n\n### What were my\u00a0options?\n\nThe first solution was to simply teach these myself, I had the statistical experience to learn machine learning and had done enough coding in MatLab to feel confident that I could learn Python or R. However, if I was to do these I was unsure if this was enough and how I would clearly demonstrate my newly acquired skills on a CV to employers.\n\nI considered online boot camps but they were often fixed in their content and I was unsure of how repeating someone else\u2019s work would be received by employers. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that these were credible to employers and were expensive to self fund. Today, only three years later, the list of courses supported by universities makes this much more of a viable option and is something that is definitely worth considering but at the time these were lacking. Unfortunately, boot camps were a costly risk that I was uncertain would pay off.\n\nTherefore, I decided to look for the options available at universities. At the time there were two types of courses that fit within my goals; business analysts courses and computer science machine learning. The former focused on applying analytics within commercial environments but, as this was run through business schools, was far more expensive at over \u00a325,000 for one year of studying. The latter provided the teaching through academic research and focused more on teaching the underlying theory than the application. Furthermore, as this was an academic course run through the Computer Science department, the cost was considerably less for the year at \u00a39,000 (for UK citizen).\n\n### What did I\u00a0choose?\n\nIn the end, I decided to play it safe and commit a full year to the academic masters in the hope that I would gain the applied knowledge in machine learning and develop my coding skills through project work.\n\nTherefore, I joined the 2016\/17 cohort of the Data Science MSc at City, University of London\u2019s Computer Science department. This was the second year the course was offered at this university and, at the time, was the only university in London that offered a Data Science Masters (though others had some variations of this).\n\n### What did I learn in the\u00a0course?\n\nThe first term consisted of the three main topics of Data Science: fundamentals of data science, machine learning and visualisations. Each module consisted of a coursework component that we were given a choice of any publicly available dataset to apply our newly learned methods on. With these, I was quickly able to improving my coding skills and even built the confidence to start sharing [these projects publicly](https:\/\/www.philiposbornedata.com\/2017\/06\/27\/test\/).\n\nIn the second term we had two core modules, Big Data and Neural Computing, and were given the choice of two optional modules. The list of options was comprehensive and enabled us to pick specialisms from computer vision to data architectures. I chose Data Visualisations (a continuation of the first term\u2019s module) and Software Agents (the basics of AI by applying Reinforcement Learning). Again, these modules included coursework and with the fundamentals from the first term, I was really able to expand my applications and think creatively. Big Data also introduced text data and natural language processing.\n\nOver the two terms, I had been given a broad overview of most of the Data Science topics and had a deep knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks from the core modules. As we moved into the first component of the course, the dissertation, we were given the choice to complete this whilst in an internship role (and be provided an extension on the deadline to account for balancing whilst working). I found a suitable role, defined my research topic and over the following months applied all the skills I had gained so far towards [applying AI within business](https:\/\/www.philiposbornedata.com\/2018\/03\/09\/masters-thesis-summary-constructing-a-narrative-using-markov-decision-processes-applied-to-data-visualisations\/).\n\n### Did I gain the skills I needed from the\u00a0course?\n\nI had two goals to achieve; to demonstrate that I understand machine learning and apply these with coding. The course not only provided a clear \u2018box tick\u2019 against these on my CV but enabled me to continue to expand my skills after with more and more interesting projects. Part of any job application is to get past the initial checks and I was now doing this much more consistently. Furthermore, as I moved into interview stages, I had all these project to discuss and truly demonstrate confidence in my understanding far more than I would have achieved on my own.\n\nThe Masters opened up all the doors that I had previously been knocking on and even had recruiters contacting me directly following the projects I had posted publicly. In the end, I found that I enjoyed the research aspect of my dissertation and the freedom to pursue the field and have since move onto a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Ironically, this is the last thing I would have considered back in 2016 but as the field is constantly expanding it is incredible to be at the forefront of this, particularly because many problems require an applied mindset and fit within commercial problems and are not simply theoretical.\n\n### What advice would I give to someone considering moving into Data\u00a0Science?\n\nThis is always a hard question for me to answer as each person\u2019s position is different so will try to offer some advice based on my experience. In short:\n\n1. **Establish** that Data Science is the right route for you and find a topic or detail to motivate this. For me, it was the ability to apply data analytics in a creative way and become a valuable asset in a business to help others improve their decisions.\n2. **Evaluate** what the jobs you want are asking for and where your set of skills currently fall short. Although I had the technical background, I had not demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning or code and needed something to achieve this. For others on my course, they had not come from maths or stats backgrounds and so needed these to strengthen their knowledge.\n3. **Review** the options available to you to gain these missing skills. For example, boot camps are increasingly more credible in the industry but they are often following a single path (i.e. learn on the same data and apply the same methods). This may work for some but I wanted to demonstrate my abilities in unique ways to stand out to employers. If you are considering a masters, thoroughly research the modules and who is organising the course as variations will exists between different departments, particularly business and academic schools.\n4. **Expand and challenge** yourself through the course, don\u2019t simply pick a course that covers topics you are already comfortable with to tick a box. Find something challenging that will encourage you to develop new skills.\n5. **Demonstrate** your new skills by publishing your projects online, either through GitHub or Kaggle or your own site. Building a portfolio of project has taken me further in any interview than trying to describe these within the time limit would allow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you find this post useful if you are considering how to get into data science and will do my best to answer any questions you have about this.

This is why, when I first read up on Data Science, I knew that I had honed in on my next target to devour and assimilate into my neural network (yes, the biological one!)\n\nBut as I started reading through the hundreds of how-to\u2019s, blogs, MOOCS, video tutorials, online books, PDFs and the rest, I only found more frustration with missing pieces to a larger and more obscure logical puzzle that was defiant and unyielding. A feeling of unrest and concern surfaced my mind as I delved more deeply into the subject getting half-baked and limited understanding allowing me to build only by following \u201chand-holding\u201d step by step instructions. This was\u00a0not\u00a0engineering! Trial after trial the matter finally became clear to me\u200a\u2014\u200aThe topic of Data Science strictly refuses to\u00a0truly\u00a0enter a mind until it is imbued with proper mathematical\/statistical foundations!\n\nAs my reading on Data Science progressed, I would read or hear terms that I knew were key to understanding how Neural Networks worked, but it was just half baked! I started seeing this trend of people seizing the opportunity to piggy back off the Data Science craze and authoring reads and making full fledged online \u201cData Camps\u201d that in the end will always avoid the real mechanics behind the subject. They breeze through the parts where mathematical foundations are necessary and move on as if it was a side matter and not required to build reliable models. Take this snippet from a free online book for Neural Networks as an example,\n\n\u201cOn a related note, the mathematical requirements to read the book are modest. There is some mathematics in most chapters, but it\u2019s usually just elementary algebra and plots of functions, which I expect most readers will be okay with. I occasionally use more advanced mathematics, but have structured the material so you can follow even if some mathematical details elude you.\u201d\n\nReading through only the second half of Chapter 1:\u00a0\u201c We\u2019ll also define the gradient of C to be the vector of partial derivatives\u201d, \u201cWe denote the gradient vector by \u2207C\u201d\u00a0and\u201cThen Equation (9) tells us that \u0394C\u2248\u2212\u03b7\u2207C\u22c5\u2207C=\u2212\u03b7\u2225\u2207C\u22252.\u201d,\u00a0all prove otherwise and goes against being \u201celementary.\u201d\n\nThis is why I found myself constantly referring back to tutorials that explained the topic of gradient descent, limits, derivatives, vectors, statistics then go back to continue my reading. But this style of learning left me with a feeling of despair resonating from my logical side whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough, I still want to know WHY and HOW!\u201d\n\nThen, one day as I was cleaning up my closet, my eyes suddenly fell on my old college\u00a0Single Variable Calculus\u00a0book by James Stewart. Followed by a sudden dramatic stare and a sense of joy from a reunion with an old friend, an innate feeling told me that an epiphany is about to occur! I opened the book - chapter 1 - and lo and behold! \u201cThis\u2026is it. It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s all there! IT\u2019S ALL THERE!\u201d Really, all the missing pieces and loose ends were so finely andreliably\u00a0described that it left no room for confusion. Yes, I do agree that only after having gone through all the Data Science tutorials that Calculus made so much more sense - but it was still a critical piece to the big Data Science puzzle.\n\nThe point I\u2019m driving here is that I feel that there are many fields in I.T. that are slowly being driven by marketing objectives and quick responses to technology hypes rather than the classic RT*M way of deeply rooted \u201cold school\u201d developers. Head hunters are scouring to find anyone that can \u201cfit the description\u201d screening people through checkoff lists and \u201chow many years of\u201d rather than searching for minds withchemical X\u00a0which in turn forces future Data Scientist to prepare to become real engineers. The pressure coming down from this flawed style of talent selection is slowly giving rise to a batch of cooky cutter engineers that sparks worry given the way the entire field of I.T. ties in together. Security, reliability, scalability and general advancements in I.T. are all negatively effected by allowing the field to grow without well founded roots. Take how Android programming tutorials started as a classic example. The push and drive behind most of the videos, MOOCs, and tutorials was to quickly jump on the demand and make things seem as easy as possible to drive\u00a0more readers\u00a0and\u00a0not\u00a0towards making strong android engineers. This finally resulted in poor android engineers that designed poorly designed apps making way for many security and stability issues. I believe this is the same trend that is taking place in the Data Science field.\n\nIn summary, if you really want to understand Data Science in a way that will allow you to have a positive impact and pave the way for your future in this ever growing field then I strongly suggest studying the basics really well - along with all the MOOCs, videos and tutorials that are still\u00a0key\u00a0in understand Data Science and Machine Learning."],["Resources to learn data science","DataScience","Hey all,\n\nThere are tons of posts on this subreddit about which resources to use to learn data science.

It's written by a data scientist at AirBnb. \n\n> The more experienced I become as a data scientist, the more convinced I am that data engineering is one of the most critical and foundational skills in any data scientist\u2019s toolkit. I find this to be true for both evaluating project or job opportunities and scaling one\u2019s work on the job.\n\n> In an earlier post, I pointed out that a data scientist\u2019s capability to convert data into value is largely correlated with the stage of her company\u2019s data infrastructure as well as how mature its data warehouse is. This means that a data scientist should know enough about data engineering to carefully evaluate how her skills are aligned with the stage and need of the company. Furthermore, many of the great data scientists I know are not only strong in data science but are also strategic in leveraging data engineering as an adjacent discipline to take on larger and more ambitious projects that are otherwise not reachable.\n\n> Despite its importance, education in data engineering has been limited. Given its nascency, in many ways the only feasible path to get training in data engineering is to learn on the job, and it can sometimes be too late. I am very fortunate to have worked with data engineers who patiently taught me this subject, but not everyone has the same opportunity. As a result, I have written up this beginner\u2019s guide to summarize what I learned to help bridge the gap.\n\nI think many of us in the field feel the same way.

But I found myself constantly being put in charge of technical and analytical projects and ended up deciding that data science was a better career for me. \n\nMy Master's program was very intense and I did well. I now know R and Statistics quite well for data munging, analysis, and visualization. I self-taught myself SQL, Python, and now, Tableau. I have many good \"tidy datasets\" projects I showcase on my resume from school and I have exposure to extremely \"un-tidy\" text-based data and business data from my years in law. I have never been an analyst, but I make sure to show that the work I did was mostly analytical, including business analysis in Excel and querying data using legal database management tools.\n\nObviously, I have a non-traditional background for a data analyst, but with the amount of time I put in, I was hoping to get some interests by now. Recruiters and connections don't reply to me 90% of the time.\n\nI just want to know at this point, is this a lost cause? Should I give up and go back to law?
